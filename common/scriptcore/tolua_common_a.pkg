  ADVERTISEMENT: do not attempt to change the name of the API functions.
  They may be in use in Lua scripts in savefiles, so once released, the
  name and signature cannot change shape even in new major versions of
  Freeciv, until the relevant save format version can no longer be loaded.
  If you really like to change a function name, be sure to keep also the
  old one running.
