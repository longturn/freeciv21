"According to legend, Slavic and Finnic tribes of Novgorod invited in the "

"Rurik established Kievan Rus' in this realm, the first Russian state. By the "
"11th century, Kievan Rus' had disintegrated into lesser princedoms, which "
"were once again united into one state by Ivan III in the 15th century. After "
"decisive victory over Sweden and large territorial gains, Peter I pronounced "
"the Russian Empire in 1721. The Russian Empire lasted until 1917 when a "
"socialist revolution dethroned the last Russian emperor. After USSR "
"dissolution in 1991 Russia appeared on world map again, now as a federative "

"Playing with a Democracy is probably the most effective way of creating a "

"The most common reason to have Democracy as your form of goverment is to "

"daring to act against your happy Democracy with you as its eternal leader. "
"If you are not planning to fight wars and you can afford to build Markets "

"interest and if you manage to make your cities to celebrate this effect is "
"even more powerful. Democracies are able to maintain a decent army and lots "

"delay scientific advance and focus on max taxing so that your economy will "

"researching too much your enemy may be able to surprise you and your "
"outdated army. With a democatic nation it is also extremely important to "
"keep your citizens not only content but happy and celebrating. Celebration "
"gives you +1 extra trade for each tile already producing trade if you manage "

"big and old cities producing most of your gold. Also, if you are attacked or "
