#
# This file aims to provide a translation for every string, even those that
# are identical.
# This leads to a bigger message catalogue than including only msgstrs that
# are different, but makes maintenance much easier, and avoids possible
# problems when users use fallback translations.
#
# Translated words include:
#
#   canceled/ing -> cancelled/ing
#   center/ed/ing -> centre/ed/ing
#   railroad -> railway
#   honor -> honour
#   neighbor -> neighbour
#   color -> colour
#   favor -> favour
#   airplane -> aeroplane
#   defense -> defence
#   offense -> offence
#   traveler/ed/ing -> traveller/ed/ing
#   fulfill -> fulfil
#   practice (verb) -> practise
#   license (noun) -> licence
#   (amphi)theater -> theatre
#   labeled/ing -> labelled/ing
#   modeled/ing -> modelled/ing
#   channeled/ing -> channelled/ing
#   labor -> labour
#   armor -> armour
#   harbor -> harbour
#   donut -> doughnut
#   gotten -> anything but :)
#   behavior -> behaviour
#   fueled -> fuelled
#   kilometer -> kilometre
#   splendor -> splendour
#
# and all manner of iz -> is (we don't use Oxford spelling), including
# the following stems:
#
#   civiliz, centraliz, coloniz, organiz, capitaliz, recogniz, initializ,
#   seculariz, optimiz, maximiz, minimiz, industrializ, militariz, localiz,
#   neutraliz, mechaniz, motoriz, specializ, miniaturiz, characteriz, monetiz,
#   urbaniz, authoriz, christianiz, familiariz, baptiz, islamiz, ...
#
# _Not_ translated:
#   mediaeval (old-fashioned)
#   dialog -> dialogue (unless _not_ referring to UI element)
#   Apollo Program -> Programme (all-American)
#   program -> programme (if referring to a computer program)
#

"Playing with Democracy? \n"
"Playing with a Democracy is probably the most effective way of creating a "
"super power, but this comes with a price. Unlike with some other setups "
"Democracies are quite vulnerable while the player is ramping up the economy. "
"The most common reason to have Democracy as your form of goverment is to "
"build an extremely powerful economy that will simply crush those nations "
"daring to act against your happy Democracy with you as its eternal leader. "
"If you are not planning to fight wars and you can afford to build Markets "
"and other trade related buildings, Democracy is probably the best choice you "
"can make. With Democracy you will get the best possible effect for compound "
"interest and if you manage to make your cities to celebrate this effect is "
"even more powerful. Democracies are able to maintain a decent army and lots "
"of workers. One very powerful strategy for you to consider is to switch "
"between max tax and max sci. If you are confident enough you may want to "
"delay scientific advance and focus on max taxing so that your economy will "
"grow really fast. There is however a catch to this. If you postpone "
"researching too much your enemy may be able to surprise you and your "
"outdated army. With a democatic nation it is also extremely important to "
"keep your citizens not only content but happy and celebrating. Celebration "
"gives you +1 extra trade for each tile already producing trade if you manage "
"to keep your cities celebrating. On some other setups using more than "
"20% luxury is usually considered bad but with Royale's trade building setup "
"it may be worth celebrating even with +40% luxury. It all depends on the "
"situiation, but it may be worth it if you manage to avoid building some "
"happiness buildings on the new cities while focusing the resources on the "
"big and old cities producing most of your gold. Also, if you are attacked or "
"need to fight wars it may make sense to home some units on the low "
"production cities. That way if those units cause unhappiness they will do it "
"for those cities that matter less to you. "
