#
# This file aims to provide a translation for every string, even those that
# are identical.
# This leads to a bigger message catalogue than including only msgstrs that
# are different, but makes maintenance much easier, and avoids possible
# problems when users use fallback translations.
#
# Translated words include:
#
#   canceled/ing -> cancelled/ing
#   center/ed/ing -> centre/ed/ing
#   railroad -> railway
#   honor -> honour
#   neighbor -> neighbour
#   color -> colour
#   favor -> favour
#   airplane -> aeroplane
#   defense -> defence
#   offense -> offence
#   traveler/ed/ing -> traveller/ed/ing
#   fulfill -> fulfil
#   practice (verb) -> practise
#   license (noun) -> licence
#   (amphi)theater -> theatre
#   labeled/ing -> labelled/ing
#   modeled/ing -> modelled/ing
#   channeled/ing -> channelled/ing
#   labor -> labour
#   armor -> armour
#   harbor -> harbour
#   donut -> doughnut
#   gotten -> anything but :)
#   behavior -> behaviour
#   fueled -> fuelled
#   kilometer -> kilometre
#   splendor -> splendour
#
# and all manner of iz -> is (we don't use Oxford spelling), including
# the following stems:
#
#   civiliz, centraliz, coloniz, organiz, capitaliz, recogniz, initializ,
#   seculariz, optimiz, maximiz, minimiz, industrializ, militariz, localiz,
#   neutraliz, mechaniz, motoriz, specializ, miniaturiz, characteriz, monetiz,
#   urbaniz, authoriz, christianiz, familiariz, baptiz, islamiz, ...
#
# _Not_ translated:
#   mediaeval (old-fashioned)
#   dialog -> dialogue (unless _not_ referring to UI element)
#   Apollo Program -> Programme (all-American)
#   program -> programme (if referring to a computer program)
#
