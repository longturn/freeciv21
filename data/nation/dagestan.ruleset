legend=_("Dagestan is a republic of Russia situated in North Caucausus\
 along the Caspian sea, it is one of the most ethnically diverse of\
 Russia's republics, it was one of the first people within the modern\
 borders of Russia to become Muslims after the Arab conquest of the\
 region in 643. Dagestan was later raded by the Mongols in 1221.\
 Dagestan eventually came under the control of Russia in 1813 and\
 was firmly in the control of Imperial Russia as of 1828.\
 Due to high taxation and general dissatisfaction with the Russian\
 government, it rose up multiple times against Russia, once in 1828,\
 and again in 1917, it eventually became an autonomous republic under\
 the Soviet Union in 1921.")
