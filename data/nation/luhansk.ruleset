legend=_(" The Luhansk People's Republic, abbreviated as LPR is an\
 unrecognised republic of Russia in the occupied parts of eastern\
 Ukraine's Luhansk Oblast, with its capital in Luhansk. The LPR was\
 created by Russian-backed paramilitaries in 2014, and it initially\
 operated as a breakaway state until it was annexed by Russia in 2022.\
 Following Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity in 2014, pro-Russian,\
 counter-revolutionary unrest erupted in the eastern part of the\
 country. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, while the armed separatists\
 seized government buildings and proclaimed the Luhansk People's Republic\
 (LPR) and Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) as independent states. This\
 sparked the war in Donbas, part of the wider Russo-Ukrainian War.\
 The LPR and DPR are sometimes described as puppet states of Russia\
 during this conflict They received no international recognition from\
 United Nations member states before 2022. On 21 February 2022, Russia\
 recognised the LPR and DPR as sovereign states. Three days later, Russia\
 launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, partially under the pretext\
 of protecting the republics. In September 2022,Russia proclaimed the\
 annexation of the LPR and other occupied territories,following\
 illegitimate referendums which were illegal under international law.")
