legend=_("The Donetsk People's Republic is an unrecognised republic of\
 Russia in the occupied parts of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast, with\
 its capital in Donetsk. The DPR was created by Russian-backed\
 aramilitaries in 2014, and it initially operated as a breakaway state\
 Until it was annexed by Russia in 2022. Following Ukraine's Revolution\
 of Dignity in 2014, pro-Russian, counter-revolutionary unrest erupted\
 in the eastern part of the country. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine,\
 while the armed separatists seized government buildings and proclaimed\
 the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic as independent\
 states. This sparked the war in Donbas, part of the wider Russo-Ukrainian\
 War. The DPR and LPR are sometimes described as puppet states of Russia\
 during this conflict. They received no international recognition from\
 United Nations member states before 2022. On 21 February 2022, Russia\
 recognised the DPR and LPR as sovereign states. Three days later, Russia\
 launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, partially under the pretext of\
 protecting the republics. Russian forces captured more of Donetsk Oblast,\
 which became part of the DPR. In September 2022, Russia proclaimed the\
 annexation of the DPR and other occupied territories, following\
 illegitimate referendums. The United Nations General Assembly passed a\
 resolution calling on countries not to recognise what it called the\
 "attempted illegal annexation" and demanded that Russia "immediately,\
 completely and unconditionally withdraw.")
