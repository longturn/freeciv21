Civ2Civ3 Ruleset for Freeciv21
==============================


OBJECTIVES
----------

- The main purpose is to get a gameplay more similar to civ3, keeping
  the combat system from civ2.

- Reduced micromanagement as much as possible. Do not be afraid by the
  amount of changes, we think this ruleset is easier to learn than
  classic rules, and it is designed so there is not a big disadvantage
  when you do not play optimally. We hope both rookies and experienced
  players can enjoy it.

- Removed the rules that allowed a sudden boost: mainly rapture growth,
  national trade routes, and the big bonuses from some governments.

  The result should be a simpler and more linear development of your
  cities, and a slower paced gameplay. With governments that keep a
  similar balance along the different ages, and smoother effects of
  terrains, units, buildings and wonders.

- All the new rules have been adapted so AI can play with them, and to
  avoid possible exploits by human players.

INFO
----

- Help texts have been updated (mainly Buildings and Wonders), so the
  info showed ingame already takes into account the changed rules. Note
  that some graphical tables from the Manual will not match (mainly
  Terrains and Governments), so better use the tables in this ReadMe as
  reference.

- We suggest new players to start a game with 6 players or so, AI skill
  level Normal, and default ruleset options (Small continental map with
  100 land tiles per player).

- For challenging games, you may place several AI players in the same
  team. For example, one team with 5 AIs together against you.

- Cheating AI level was adjusted for these rules, we suggest experienced
  players to use it.
  CHEATING AI: +40% Science, Luxury, Gold and Production, +40 AI love,
  +40% Veteran chance, +40% Bribe and Incite costs, -20% Pollution,
  +1 Content per city, no food penalty from units.

The following is a full list of changes compared to classic ruleset...


CORE CHANGES
------------

- No Rapture Growth. Celebration only causes additional Trade per tile,
  same as civ3. Foodbox readjusted to keep a constant city growth.

- Settlers cost 2 population (as in civ3). This way, the number of tiles
  worked in the original city are reduced by 2, equal to the number of
  tiles worked in the newly created city.

- Disabled national Trade Routes: it is still possible to create Trade
  Routes, but only to foreign cities that you are not at war with
  (trade routes are canceled when war breaks out). Each city can
  support a maximum of 2 trade routes. Removed the one time revenues.

- Every unit (except Settlers/Migrants, which cost population to build)
  pays some kind of Upkeep cost. Under some governments, this upkeep is
  changed from Shields to Gold (similar to civ3).

- A city can support as many military and Settler/Migrant units as its
  population size (min 4, max 20). Additional units cause waste of Food.
  If the city shrinks due to starvation, one of those extra units will
  be disbanded.

- Units lose one Veteran level when upgraded.

- Enabled tired attack: units that attack with less than a single move
  point will have their attack power reduced accordingly.
  If they have 2/3 movement points, they will attack with 2/3 strength.
  If they have 1/3 movement points, they will attack with 1/3 strength.

- Unlimited movement on rails delayed to maglev (available with
  Superconductors). Movement bonus on Railroads x6, on Roads x3, on
  Rivers x3 (non diagonal).

- The 'restrictinfra' server setting applies to rivers as well as to
  roads/railroads.

- Added Fort and Airstrip bases, required before you can build Fortress
  or Airbase, respectively. It prevents the construction of full bases
  in one single turn. The bases no longer protect full stacks from being
  killed when one unit is defeated.

- Specialists output reduced to 2 (same as civ2). There are wonders that
  increase it to 3 for all players.

- Enabled Tech Leakage: technologies are cheaper if already discovered
  by other nations you have Embassy with.

- The cost of each Tech is equal to the number of steps needed to get
  the tech (Tech Cost = Base Cost * Number of Parents). It is a linear
  formula more similar to civ2, and it fits better the new reduced
  bonuses from Trade and Science.

- Tech Upkeep assigned to Cities: some science is required from each
  city to maintain a given technological level. The upkeep grows from 0
  during the middle ages, up to 10 Bulbs per city when the whole tech
  tree was researched. If the global balance of Bulbs ends negative, one
  technology is lost, and half of its value is restored to the count of
  Bulbs.

- No holes allowed in tech tree. To acquire a tech you must know its
  prerequisites, and you cannot lose a tech that another depends on.

- Some buildings, and all wonders, generate culture points in your
  cities; certain achievements such as mapping the world also generate
  culture points. By default, this only affects score; it also affects
  migration (which is not enabled by default), and a cultural victory
  can optionally be enabled.

- Enabled risk of Plague at cities with population greater than 4. Chances
  reduced by the buildings Aqueduct and Sewer System, the tech Medicine,
  and the wonder Cure for Cancer.

- Added other random disasters: Earthquake, Fire, Flood, Industrial
  Accident, and Nuclear Accident.

- Increased AI_love for AI players, in order to reduce the amount of
  wars between them.

OPTIONAL RULES
--------------

- Every player starts with 1 free Tech, 1 Settler, 1 Worker,
  1 Explorer, and 1 Diplomat. ('startunits', 'techlevel')

- Minimum Distance between cities set to 3. ('citymindist')

- Initial National Border equal to city radius (2 tiles). ('borders')

- Restricted the use of infrastructure (roads, railroads, and rivers)
  for enemy units. ('restrictinfra')

- Unreachable units do not protect reachable ones. ('unreachableprotects')

- Set Occupy Chance to 100%: Units automatically move to the target tile
  if the attack is successful and ZoC rules allow the movement.
  ('occupychance')

- Halved change of building loss when city is conquered. ('razechance')

- Revolutions become quicker the more times any player has changed to
  the target government. ('revolentype')


FOODBOX
-------

- City FoodBox Size uniformed to even the population wasted when you
  build Settlers at larger cities (similar to civ3).

- Granary size is fixed to 10 Food for every city size.

- Cities with Pop <= 4 receive this granary effect for free, so they can
  create Settlers at best rate even without Granary. (This free granary
  helps the AI to build Settlers optimally).

====== ========= ========== ========= ==========

Legend:

- ^ = Granary effect for free when city grows to this city level.
- FOODBOX = Foodbox size at that city level. (In brackets = Granary size).
- SETTLER = Food needed to recover the population if you create a Settler
  at that city size. (In brackets = The same but with Granary).
- NEW = This ruleset.
- OLD = Classic ruleset

TIP: In order to keep max growth, you should build the Granary before
city grows larger than Pop 4 (same as Aqueduct at Pop 8, and
Sewer System at Pop 16).

TIP: Optimal production of Settlers occurs at any city with Pop <= 4, or
cities with Granary and Pop <= 6.


TERRAIN
-------

- Jungles receive +1 Shield (1/1/0). Swamps can be irrigated for +1 Food
  (to 2/0/0). Tundras can be mined for +1 Shield (instead of irrigated)
  and receive +1 Trade when roaded (up to 1/1/1).

- Deserts with a river receive 1 extra Food from irrigation (total 2),
  unless they have an Oasis; this simulates a growth boost like Nile
  floods.

- Reduced Food bonus by 1 to Swamp/Spice; the original bonus can be
  obtained by irrigating the Swamp.

- Hills receive 1 Shield for free, and +2 from mines, same as civ3,
  (was 0 and +3). Mountains receive +2 Shields from mines too (was +1).

- Mountains give extra vision range. Cities can not be placed over
  Mountains. Land units starting the turn on unroaded Mountains receive a -1
  penalty to movement (this way it is not so good for cavalry to end the
  turn on Mountains).

- The discovery of Refining allows to upgrade the mines placed on
  Deserts and Glaciers to Oil Wells (+2 Shields in total).

- Lake tiles receive for free +1 Food (2/0/2), while Harbours and
  Offshore Platforms do not affect them. Lakes do not enable wonders
  that needs a coastal city.

- Deep ocean tiles must be mined (resulting in an Oil Platform) in order to
  take advantage of the shield bonus from Offshore Platforms.

- Pollution may appear in Ocean tiles, and Transports can clean it
  without the need of Workers/Engineers. Jungles and Forests are less
  affected by global warming.

- Cities on rivers always get roads, even before Bridge Building
  is known.

- No minimum city output (was 1/1/0). City central tile simply gets
  +1 Shield. This way, no matter the tile where you place your city,
  you never waste any resource (for example, with classic rules, a
  city placed over bonused Grassland was wasting the Shield bonus).

========= ====== ========== ========== ====== ====== ====== ===========

Legend:

- F/P/T = Food/Production/Trade
- [t] = turns
- MAX1 = irrigated/mined/roaded/harbour
- MAX2 = farmland/railroad/oil well.
- ^ = Changes compared to classic ruleset. Most affected are Jungles, Swamps and Tundras.

TIP: The optimal tiles to place your initial cities are those with MAX
output equal or greater than 2/1/1, mainly those with bonus
resources or rivers. Hills and Plains are always good places for
cities, as well as Flood Desert (desert with river), or bonused
Grassland. The best defense comes from cities placed on Hills with
river.


DEFENSE
-------

- Halved the terrain defense bonuses, now more similar to civ3 values:

Buildings each add:

SDI Defense      +0%      +0%      +0%      +100%
================ ======== ======== ======== ==========

- Every City of any size receives an inherent Defend_Bonus = +50%
  against all kinds of land units.

- Every City with Pop>8 receives an additional free Defend_Bonus = +50%
  against both land and sea units.

- Walls effect reduced from 200% to 100%, and cost reduced from 60
  to 30.

- Great Wall gives additional Defend_Bonus = +50% against Land units,
  and prevents population loss in any city when a defending unit loses.

Total Defense = (UNIT DEFENSE) * (100+TERRAIN)/100 * (100+RIVER)/100
* (100+CITY+BASE)/100 * (100+FORTIFIED)/100 * (100+VETERAN)/100

(Same as classic rules).


EXAMPLE: Riflemen fortified in a fortress, on mountains, with a river,
will get a total defense of 30 against land attacks:

- Riflemen: defense 4
- Fortified (+50%): 4 + 2 = 6
- In Fortress (+100%):      6 + 6 = 12
- On Mountains (+100%):             12 + 12 = 24
- With River (+25%):                          24 + 6 = 30.

EXAMPLE: Riflemen in a size 9 city, with walls, on hills,
will get a total defense of 27 against land attacks:

- Fortified (+50%): 4 + 2 = 6
- On Hills (+50%):          6 + 3 = 9
- In City with Walls (+200%):       9 + 18 = 27.

==================== ========== ========== ========= ========== ======== ========== ========== ========== ==========


Legend:

- ^ = Corruption by Distance is doubled until The Corporation is researched
  by the player (or increased to 1 for Federation).
- ^^ = Waste by Distance is doubled until Trade is researched by the player.
- (#) = This penalty is negated by The Pyramids wonder, or when Railroad is
  researched by the player.


Partisans appear in conquered cities (democratic or communist) if
Guerilla Warfare has been researched by any player.

Added Fundamentalism (available with Theology), Tribal (available at
start) and Federation (available with Economics).

- "Base Corruption/Waste": Modern governments cause less Trade
  Corruption, but more Wasted Production. The total % lost (Waste +
  Corruption) is equal for all governments.

- "Empire Size" (number of cities that start causing extra unhappiness):
  Modern governments have double size limit than his ancient
  counterpart. Empire Base Size is equal to Empire Step Size for every
  government.

- "Unit Upkeep": Tribal, Republic and Communism use the standard unit
  upkeep by Shields, while the other governments use Gold upkeep
  (x2 Gold per unit for modern governments).

- "Free Units": Means units free of Gold/Shield upkeep and also free of
  Military Unhappiness. By default 2 free units per city.

- "Mil Unhappiness": Most governments are affected by Military
  Unhappiness due to units out of cities/fortresses (same as Republic
  in classic ruleset).

- "Martial Law": Max 3 units can apply Martial Law (was max 20 for
  Despotism and Anarchy).

- The bonus "+1 Trade" under Republic and Democracy does not affect
  oceanic tiles. This way, oceanic tiles are more even to land tiles
  under any government.

- Republic receives Revolution_When_Unhappy and has unbribable units,
  Federation receives Has_senate and has unincitable cities (Democracy
  receives all them).

- Spies built under Communism or Federation will start at the first
  veteran level. Federation grants +2 Luxury per city.

- Under Communism you do not pay upkeep for buildings that cost 1 Gold.
  Communism cancels the bonus from Mysticism and Theology (to Temples
  and Cathedrals).

- Under Fundamentalism you receive extra Gold from Tithes, but -50% to
  Science.

- The Bonus to production at Palace (under Despotism and Monarchy)
  switched from Shields to Gold.

- Tribal government increases by half the chance of land units getting
  the next veteran level after a battle. Every city gets 1 extra content
  citizen, but units can't apply Martial Law.

TIP: There is some hurry to get Monarchy or Republic (or to build
Pyramids), in order to avoid the initial penalty to output per
tile. However, the Corruption and Waste are evened for all
governments, so there are no big differences, and every government
could be used at any technological age. The choice depends on the
role of your civilization.


TECHS
-----

- Added new wonders: Mausoleum of Mausolos (available with Ceremonial
  Burial), and Statue of Zeus (available with Polytheism). Oracle of
  Delphi renamed to Temple of Artemis (in order to allow all 7 wonders).

- Moved Great Wall to Construction (was Masonry). Moved King Richard's
  Crusade to Chivalry, so it requires Monarchy and Knights. Women's
  Suffrage moved to Conscription, so it requires Democracy. Switched
  Darwin's Voyage and Eiffel Tower (Darwin was earlier than Eiffel).
  Shakespeare's Theatre available with Sanitation (was Medicine).

- Diplomats available with Alphabet (was Writing), and Migrants with
  Pottery, so every initial tech allows some unit or building.

- Coastal Defense moved to Magnetism*. AI likes defense improvements and
  this change encourages them to develop Frigates/Galleons early in
  game.
  (*) The labels and icons for "Magnetism" and "Navigation" were
  switched, because compass was already used by historical Caravels,
  while sextants were not invented until the age of Galleons/Frigates.

- Construction requires Iron Working instead of Currency. This way,
  Iron Working is a prerequisite to build Frigates and Ironclads.

- Bridge Building merged to old Engineering in the tech tree. Added
  modern "Engineering" in the Industrial Ages that allows Destroyers
  (was Electricity) and Transports (was Industrialization), and it is
  required for Steel (Cruiser), Amphibious Warfare (Ports), and
  Combustion (Submarines).

- Battleship available with Mass Production instead of Automobile.
  Mfg Plant available with Plastics (was Robotics).

- Nuclear Fission requires Refrigeration, in order to delay the Atomic
  age, and to force the AI to research farms. Communism requires
  Theology (Fundamentalism) instead of Philosophy, to encourage AI to
  research all governments.

- Fusion Power allows Engineers to perform terrain transformations, that
  were simplified so there is no need to chain more than one
  transformation in the same terrain.

Special effects:

- Astronomy: Increases units vision when in fortresses.
- Invention: Halves upgrade cost of your units.
- Medicine: Reduces by 30% the chance of illness in your cities.
- Electricity: Allows irrigation without adjacent water, increases city
  vision radius, and the effect of Colosseums.
- Trade: Decreases one-time the waste of Shields caused by distance to
  capital.
- The Corporation: Decreases one-time the corruption of Trade caused by
  distance to capital.

The Techs, Buildings, Wonders and Units are the same as civ2, but some
requirements have been changed to improve a bit the historical accuracy,
to encourage the use of every military unit, and to avoid units or
wonders becoming obsolete too soon. The following is a list of some
inaccuracies from classic tech tree that were addressed in the new tree:

- It was possible to research Pikemen before Phalanxs; Musketeers before
  Pikemen; Ironclads before Frigates; Destroyers before Ironclads;
  Armors before Artillery; Mech Infantry without Barracks III.
- Cathedrals did not require Construction nor Masonry. Ironclads and
  Eiffel Tower were available without Iron Working. Chivalry and Pikemen
  did not need Iron nor Bronze.
- Pottery was not needed to research Trade, Economics, Explosives,
  Invention, or Sanitation.
- Chemistry was not related to Atomic theory, Refrigeration, Gunpowder,
  Steam Engine, or Steel.
- Theory of Gravity did not need Physics, Invention, or even The Wheel,
  and it was not needed for Automobile, Robotics, or Miniaturization.
- Offshore Platforms did not require Refining, Combustion or Explosives.
  Miniaturization was not needed for Rocketry or Laser.

In the new tree, you are forced to research most of the ancient techs
before you can research the modern ones, but overall, researching paths
are similar to classic tree.


BUILDINGS
---------

- Aqueduct is cheaper near rivers or lakes. Sewer System is needed to
  grow larger than pop 16 (instead of 12). Each one reduces the chances
  of illness by -30%.

- Created a new building: Ecclesiastical Palace (available with
  Theology), that acts as a second center of government that lowers
  corruption and waste.

- Courthouse: Make_Content = 1, and reduces to half any kind of waste
  (Trade, Shields or Food).

  Added new effect: Food wasted by distance to Palace = -1% Food each 2
  tiles.

  For example, cities at distance 20 of the Palace lose -10% Food
  (-5% with courthouse), so they lose -1 Food when their production
  reaches 10 Food per turn (20 Food per turn with courthouse),
  noticeable when city reaches size 5 or so (around city size 10 with
  courthouse).

- Granary halves the waste of food caused by distance to Palace.
  Together with a Courthouse, it eliminates completely the waste of
  food.

- Police Station: Make_Content = 2, and reduces unhappiness caused by 1
  Military unit.

- Science bonus by buildings (Library, University and Research Lab)
  restored to civ2 values (+50%). There are wonders that double the
  effect later.

- Production bonus by Factory and Mfg Plant reduced to +25% each
  (was +50%), so the Power Plants are as important as the Factories.
  Mfg Plants allows the construction of 2 units per turn.

- Super Highways double the effect of Stock Exchange (+50% to
  Gold/Luxuries), and they produce extra Trade at tiles with roads but
  without farmlands (the classic effect was overpowered under
  Democracy/Republic). The city center tile can still have both farmland
  and Super Highways bonuses.

- Doubled costs of all Spaceship parts. All them require Library,
  University, Research Lab and Factory present in the city in order to
  be built.

- Reduced by one the gold upkeep of Aqueduct, Colosseum (renamed to
  Amphitheatre), University, Bank, Stock Exchange, Port Facility,
  SDI Defense, Factory and Mfg Plant.

- Pollution caused by population is increased by buildings instead of by
  techs:
  Industrialization->Factory; Automobile->Highways; Plastics->Mfg Plant;
  Mass Production->Offshore platforms.

- Adjusted the Pollution of all Power Plants, and increased building
  cost of Nuclear Plants:

============== ===== ======== =========== ===================
Item           Cost  Upkeep   Shields     Pollution(+Recycle)
============== ===== ======== =========== ===================
Power plant    130   4        +25%/+50%   100%(50%)
Hydro plant    180   4        +25%/+50%   50% (25%)
(+Hoover Dam)  (=)   (=)      (=)         25% (0%)
Nuclear plant  240   2        +25%/+50%   50% (25%)
Solar plant    320   4        +25%/+50%   25% (0%)
============== ===== ======== =========== ===================


UNITS
-----

- Settlers pop cost increased to 2 and removed the upkeep. New unit
  Migrants available to work, or to migrate 1 pop, they can't create
  cities and can be captured. Costs more similar to civ3:

    - Settlers:  pop_cost = 2, cost = 30, upkeep = 0
    - Migrants:  pop_cost = 1, cost = 10, upkeep = 0
    - Workers:   pop_cost = 0, cost = 20, upkeep = 1

- Non-military units now belongs to a new unit class ("Small Land") that
  can not pillage, nor capture cities, and does not create Zones of
  Control that would affect the movements of enemy units.

- Created a new unit class for Caravans and Freights ("Merchant") that
  doesn't get the unlimited movement from Maglev, and can be captured.
  They can only establish Trade Routes to foreign cities.

- Land units can capture enemy Migrants (as slaves) and
  Caravans/Freights (as loot).

- Wheeled units (new unit class "Big Land") can't move to Mountains,
  Jungles and Swamps, unless they are travelling on a road. They do not
  get defensive bonuses from the terrain, can not perform pillage, and
  need Galleons or Transports to travel by sea.

- Only "Big Land" units can cause population loss when attacking a city.

- Units stay alive when they establish embassies or investigate cities,
  and they can do it directly from boats without disembarking. Explorers
  can also perform those two actions, same as Diplomats. Increased
  vision range of Explorers and Partisans.

- Added Elephants from civ2, available with Polytheism:
  (at/def/mov-hp,cost) = (3/2/2-10,30). Obsolete by Dragoons.

- Added Crusaders from civ2, available with Monotheism: (5/1/2-10,40).
  Obsolete by Dragoons. They do not cause military unhappiness.

- Added Fanatics from civ2, available with Guerrilla, under
  Fundamentalism government: (5/5/1-20,20). They cost 1 population, but
  do not cause unhappiness and do not need upkeep.

- Archers defense reduced to 1 (was 2), and cost to 20 (was 30). Legion
  cost reduced to 30 (was 40). This way the ratio Attack/Cost of ancient
  units is more even to Catapults.

- Pikemen changed to (2/3), cost to 30, and removed the doubled defense
  vs horses. Attack of Chariots increased to 4 (was 3). Defense of
  Knights increased to 3 (was 2). In order to encourage early use of
  cavalry.

- Alpine Troops changed to (7/4), and Partisan to (4/5). This way,
  Riflemen do not become obsolete as city defenders until Partisan or
  Marine are researched, and every modern infantry is somehow useful.

- Given Marine ability to Legion, Musketeer, and Rifleman. This way,
  one-tile islands can be assaulted early in game. Yet, the Marine unit
  is still the best offensive/defensive infantry.

- Triremes can navigate rivers. Caravel changed from (2/1) to (1/2), in
  order to encourage peaceful exploration of the seas in the age of
  discovery.

- Removed transport capability from Frigates, to force the use of
  Galleons. Reduced attack of Frigate and defense of Ironclad to 3
  (was 4).

- Battleship hit points reduced to 30 (was 40), Ironclad and Submarine
  to 20 (was 30). Doubled the defense of Destroyers against Submarines.
  Now there is a Rock-paper-scissors relation between
  Destroyer-Cruiser-Submarine.

- All units that had Firepower 2 now have Firepower 1, in order to even
  the power of naval, air, and artillery units, and to simplify the
  mental calculation to compare them.

- Artillery and Howitzer receive the ability CityBuster, so their
  firepower is 1 in open field, and 2 against cities. Removed Ignore
  Walls for Howitzer (that would bypass the new city defense bonuses),
  and reduced movement to 1.

- Bombers and Helicopters receive the Bombarder ability: when they
  attack land units, they can only damage (not kill) them, but damage
  every unit in a stack or city; and are never damaged while attacking.
  Note they have a normal attack against sea units (they still can kill
  or die). Halved the attack so it is harder to bombard land enemies
  successfully. Increased hit points so it is still possible to kill
  naval units.

- Air units can perform pillage (representing bombardment of
  infrastructure), and can be Airlifted from a city with an Airport to
  another. Increased defense of all Air units, in order to discourage
  the use of Land units to protect them.

- Increased fuel of all planes by one (giving them an extra turn in
  the air), in order to allow battles for air control. All planes
  lose 10% of HPs, like helicopters, when they end a turn outside a city,
  airstrip, or airbase.

- Helicopters can carry 1 military Land unit, and can only be attacked
  by Fighters (with no extra attack bonuses), and by Missiles. Carriers
  can also transport military Land units.

- Cruise Missile no longer cause unhappiness, range increased to 16,
  and allowed to attack Air units.

- Nuclear weapons can be built with Nuclear Fission, but you need
  Advanced Flight to move them, and Rocketry to get max movement.

- Readjusted many costs so units with better stats are always more
  expensive. At the same time, modern units always get better ratio
  Att/Cost or Def/Cost.

WONDERS
-------

Readjusted effects for most wonders. Restored all civ2 costs.

- Modified all effects that worked as if you had certain building in
  every city.

- Replaced every effect Make_Happy, Force_content, and No_unhappy, by
  additional Luxury in the central city tile. Else they would allow a
  possible exploit to avoid unhappiness caused by Military units.

- Replaced effect that gives a percentage bonus to Science output, by
  additional Science in the central city tile. This way, they do not
  multiply the effect of other wonders like Colossus, and it is not an
  advantage to build them all in the same city.

- Your Caravans and Freight can help build allies' or team-mates'
  wonders.

- Wonders become obsolete by techs researched by the owner (not affected
  by the researches of other players).

- Some Wonders require certain building in the city to be built.
