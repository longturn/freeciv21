Playing with Republic? \n\
Republic is the fast lane to Democracy and it is quite bad if you plan to fight wars. \
Unlike with some other governments you can declare wars while in Republic. This \
however comes with a hefty price unless you manage to keep the wars extremely short or \
you crush a very weak enemy. Republics can succeed if you have a very low number of \
units and you can afford to focus on building Markets, Mercantile Exchanges, and Banks \
instead of military units and huge numbers of workers. One of the best ways to succeed \
with a Republic is to make peace or alliance with everyone around you and then focus on \
ramping up your economy. Republic may also work better if your cities have overlapping \
tiles. If you have little space for your empire it may make sense to micromanage the \
worked tiles as Republic as your government. This will allow you to reduce the number \
of workers since overlapping city improvements will make it possible to use the same \
improved tile for two or more cities. For example, when one city is about to grow (currently \
getting +3 food) and needs +2 food you may switch a grassland tile (irrigated, resource +1 \
production, and roads) to another city and use a regular plans tile (irrigated, with roads) \
for the city only needing +2 food. This way you do not produce +1 extra food going to waste \
and the other city will benefit from the same worker tile. Like always there are many ways to \
deal with the governments and another way to look at this is saying that in Republic you can \
afford more buildings, while in Monarchy you can afford more units. Going from Monarchy to \
Democracy is a popular route even while in some situations adding Fedetation between them \
might make sense.\

Playing with Democracy? \n\
Playing with a Democracy is probably the most effective way of creating a super power, \
but this comes with a price. Unlike with some other setups Democracies are quite vulnerable \
while the player is ramping up the economy. The most common reason to have Democracy as your \
form of goverment is to build an extremely powerful economy that will simply crush those \
nations daring to act against your happy Democracy with you as its eternal leader. If you are \
not planning to fight wars and you can afford to build Markets and other trade related buildings, \
Democracy is probably the best choice you can make. With Democracy you will get the best possible \
effect for compound interest and if you manage to make your cities to celebrate this effect is even \
more powerful. Democracies are able to maintain a decent army and lots of workers. One very powerful \
strategy for you to consider is to switch between max tax and max sci. If you are confident enough \
you may want to delay scientific advance and focus on max taxing so that your economy will grow \
really fast. There is however a catch to this. If you postpone researching too much your enemy \
may be able to surprise you and your outdated army. With a democatic nation it is also extremely \
important to keep your citizens not only content but happy and celebrating. Celebration gives you \
+1 extra trade for each tile already producing trade if you manage to keep your cities celebrating. \
On some other setups using more than 20% luxury is usually considered bad but with Royale's trade \
building setup it may be worth celebrating even with +40% luxury. It all depends on the situiation, \
but it may be worth it if you manage to avoid building some happiness buildings on the new cities while \
focusing the resources on the big and old cities producing most of your gold. Also, if you are attacked \
or need to fight wars it may make sense to home some units on the low production cities. That way if \
those units cause unhappiness they will do it for those cities that matter less to you.\
