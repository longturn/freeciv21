; Modifying this file:
; You should not modify this file except to make bugfixes or
; for other "maintenance".  If you want to make custom changes,
; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the
; command "rulesetdir <mysubdir>" in the server to have freeciv
; use your new customized file.
;
; You should sort role units from worst to better, as often the best
; available role unit of a given sort will be picked by choosing
; the first available (not obsolete) such unit, or by picking the last
; such unit directly. When determining starting units, the first
; unit with the relevant role that the player can build will be chosen.
; If no such unit can be found (eg Explorers that require Seafaring),
; then the first unit with this role will be chosen.

; "GameLoss"	= losing one of these units means you lose the game, but it

; "EvacuateFirst" = the game will try to rescue units with this flag before

 Why: This unit is the end of an upgrade patch all the way from the warriors. It's the best non armored unit for defending your cities.\
 This was added so that the riflemen could be upgraded into something else than marines. Upgading those and the previous units\
 into marines created issues to the gameplay. The players were taking huge risks by building lots of cheap early units.\
 The plan was to uprade the early units at a later time for offensive purposes. Upgrading the early units into marines created situations where the game\
 ended (for some players) in a turn or two with no real warning. With this one as the final upgrade the problem is no more because of this upgrade path.\
 The infantry unit also allows an alternative research path because of the reasonably good defense value.\
