; Modifying this file:
; You should not modify this file except to make bugfixes or
; for other "maintenance".  If you want to make custom changes,
; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the
; command "rulesetdir <mysubdir>" in the server to have Freeciv21
; use your new customized file.
;
; You should sort role units from worst to better, as often the best
; available role unit of a given sort will be picked by choosing
; the first available (not obsolete) such unit, or by picking the last
; such unit directly. When determining starting units, the first
; unit with the relevant role that the player can build will be chosen.
; If no such unit can be found (eg Explorers that require Seafaring),
; then the first unit with this role will be chosen.

; "GameLoss"	= losing one of these units means you lose the game, but it

It is the best non-armored unit for defending your cities. This was \
added so that the Riflemen could be upgraded into something else than \
Marines. Upgading those and the previous units into Marines created issues \
to the gameplay. The players were taking huge risks by building lots of cheap \
early units. The plan was to uprade the early units at a later time for o\
ffensive purposes. Upgrading the early units into Marines created situations \
where the game ended (for some players) in a turn or two with no real warning. \
With this one as the final upgrade the problem is no more because of this upgrade \
path. The Infantry unit also allows an alternative research path because of the \
reasonably good defense value.\
