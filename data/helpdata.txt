Freeciv21 is a turn-based strategy game, in which each player becomes the leader of a Civilization. You \
compete against several opponents to build Cities, use them to support a military and economy, and finally \
to complete an empire that survives all encounters with its neighbors to emerge victorious. Each opponent \
may be either another human or controlled by the computer. All players begin at the dawn of history in 4,000 \
BCE with a handful of Units. Depending on the ruleset selected this is typically an Explorer and a couple of \
Settlers. The race then begins to expand outward from those humble beginnings.\
"), _("\
Achieving success requires a balance between economic expansion, military strength, and Technological \
development. Not only must you develop all three in concert to both expand and successfully defend your \
empire, but any of these four items may provide victory over your opponents:\
"), _("\
 - As in other games of conquest and expansion, you are declared the winner by default once the last City \
and Unit of every other Civilization is destroyed.\n\
 - Once Technological progress has brought you into the space age, you may launch a spaceship destined for \
Alpha Centauri. The first Civilization whose spaceship reaches the system wins. NOTE: Spacerace Victory is
set by the ruleset and thereby may not be not enabled for all games.\n\
 - In the absence of other means to determine victory, the game will end after 5,000 turns if no spaceship \
have been launched. The surviving Civilizations are then rated, and the one with the highest score is \
the winner.\n\
 - If playing a multiplayer game with only humans, victory can be declared based on diplomatic factors and \
other pre-set game rules.\
"), _("\
NOTE: Freeciv21 is highly customizable, both through run time configuration and through custom rulesets, \
which can change almost any aspect of the game rules. This help system tries to adapt to different rules, \
but may not completely cover rulesets which are very different from the classic rules.\

[help_strategy_and_tactics]
name = _("Strategy and Tactics")
text = _("\
While every game is different, there is a basic strategy which most players follow, especially at the start \
of the game.\
"), _("\
These steps may vary depending upon the server or ruleset options, but in general, the steps are: \
"), _("\
 0. Choosing the first City site.\n\
 1. Mapping the countryside.\n\
 2. Defending the Cities.\n\
 3. Deciding which Units to build first.\n\
 4. Improving the land.\n\
 5. Deciding where to build Cities.\n\
 6. Taking care of the Cities.\n\
 7. Interacting with other players (diplomacy).\n\
 8. Exploring the World.\n\
 9. Things to keep in mind.\n\
10. Making your own strategy for the game.\
"), _("\
 0. Choosing the first City site.\
"), _("\
Start the game by wandering around BRIEFLY to find a good place to build the first City. Do not feel tempted \
to investigate any yellow roofed villages yet, they might contain Barbarian tribes. Build the City close to \
resources and perhaps close to fresh water (River or Lake). Keep in mind that the first City you build will \
be your capital! The idea is to balance the quality of the site you find against getting your first City \
established as early as possible.\
"), _("\
 1. Mapping the countryside.\
"), _("\
After the Capital City has been built, it will start producing a Warrior Unit by default. These Units can \
be used to walk around exploring the countryside, especially if you do not have any Explorers. Remember, it \
is risky to leave a City undefended, so perhaps keep the first Warrior in the City, and use the following \
one to explore. If you started the game with an Explorer Unit, use that to explore and open up the Map.\
"), _("\
 2. Defending the Cities.\
"), _("\
At this point, defend your Cities by always leaving a Warrior Unit in them. As your Civilization develops \
and new Units become available, replace the obsolete Units with new ones to ensure your Cities have
sufficient defense. The Units most often used for defense are (in order of strength): Warrior, Phalanx, \
Pikemen, Musketeers, Riflemen, and Mechanized Infantry.\
"), _("\
Keep in mind that with some types of Government, military Units inside or outside Cities can reduce or \
create unhappiness. Also remember that when a land Unit is inside a City, it gets a 50% defensive bonus, as \
if fortified. This happens automatically. When a new City is built, the City starts to build the best \
available defensive Unit from the above list.\
"), _("\
 3. Deciding which Units to build first.\
"), _("\
After building one or two Warrior Units, start building Settlers. Settlers take City population, but if you \
picked a good City site, your City should be big enough by now. The amount of population that it takes to \
build a Settler is ruleset dependent, so read the help item for Settlers as part of initial growth planning. \
Settlers are best put to use building new Cities, while they can also build infrastructure Improvements (see \
the next section), it is better to use Workers for this when available. It should be noted that unlike \
Settlers, Workers do not consume Food from their parent City. Keep in mind that a large population increases \
both the amount of productivity and your Civilization's research rate, not to mention that Cities secure \
land for your empire, so building new Cities should be a high priority in the early game.\
"), _("\
 4. Improving the land.\
"), _("\
Each City has an area of land around it that can be used for growing Food, Producing goods, and generating \
Trade. This output can be increased by using Workers (or Settlers) to improve the land close to your Cities. \
The land can be improved with irrigation (increasing Food output), roads (allowing Units to move faster and \
increasing Trade), and mines (increasing Production), among other Improvements. The ability to do some \
Improvements on some Tiles may require Technology.\
"), _("\
 5. Deciding where to build Cities.\
"), _("\
The best location for a City is a matter of taste. A City which is placed near the sea is easier to spot by \
opponents, but can also serve as a port for seagoing Units. They also usually need a Coastal Defense City \
Improvement later on for defense against an attacking navy. The best strategy is to build a few of both, but \
keep in mind that your opponents will find it harder to locate your City if you do not build it by the sea.
Another thing to consider is the land around the City in its \"Vision Radius\". The Vision Radius is the the \
Map Tiles that the City's population can manage as it grows. Many land Tiles will have resources on them \
(called Specials) that give Food, Production, or Trade bonuses. Use the middle-click on your mouse to see. \
The more resources a City can utilize the better.\
"), _("\
 6. Taking care of the Cities.\
"), _("\
Every City has a group of Citizens. The number of Citizens depends on the City's population. When you click \
on a City, you can see how the land around the City is being managed. You can assign the City's Citizens to \
manage the land, or they can be Specialists that contribute to your Civilization in other ways. Especially \
at the start of the game, care should be taken to ensure that the Citizens are employed so that they \
maximize Food, Trade, and then Production.\
"), _("\
If too much Food is being generated, a Citizen can be taken off the land by clicking on the occupied land \
Tile. This Citizen can then be transferred to a Specialist. There are three Specialists: Taxmen (collect \
Gold), Entertainers (create Happiness), or Scientist (create Bulbs). By default, Freeciv21 will add an \
Entertainer when you take a Citizen off the land.\
"), _("\
If you click on the central Tile of the land (the \"City Center\"), the Citizens will be rearranged to \
maximize Food production. You will also want to look at the level of Food in the Granary and the amount of \
surplus Food the City is producing each turn. The City will lose excess Food at turn change. For example:
The Granary in the City has 18/20 Food (needs two Food to grow to next City size) and the City is currently \
producing +4 Food surplus each turn. This means that at turn change you will lose 2 Food as waste at turn \
change. This is a good opportunity to move the Citizens around to get Food to +2 surplus. This could \
be accomplished by taking a Citizen off a Tile producing 2 Food and turn it into a Taxman for a turn to get \
Gold. At turn change, open the City and restore the Citizen to farming. This kind of individual City \
management style is called \"micro-management\" and is a very powerful mechanism of game play.\
"), _("\
The golden rule of taking care of a City is that there should be at least as many Happy Citizens as Unhappy \
Citizens. A City where this is not so falls into disorder. Such Cities are labeled with a raised fist or a \
lightning bolt (depending on the tileset). Take care not to let this happen to any of your Cities, as Cities \
in disorder produce nothing, and are prone to revolt.\
"), _("\
 7. Interacting with other players (diplomacy).\
"), _("\
When one of your Units first meets a Unit of another nation, or finds one of their Cities (or equally if \
they find you), a basic contact is established between the two nations. This provides each with basic \
intelligence about the other, which can be accessed from the 'Nations' View.\
"), _("\
This communication will lapse after a ruleset defined number of turns with no contact. Establishing an \
Embassy will give a more permanent communication channel, as well as more advanced intelligence such as \
details of Technology. Embassies are one-way, the nation hosting the Embassy receives no benefit and once \
established, cannot be revoked.\
"), _("\
If you are in contact with another player, then you can arrange a diplomatic meeting. From the 'Nations' \
View, this is done by selecting the nation with whom you wish to meet and clicking 'Meet'. If the entry \
under the Embassy column is not blank and the other player is connected (or is a server AI) then a treaty \
dialog will pop up.\
"), _("\
In this dialog you can negotiate an exchange of assets (Maps, Vision, Advances, Cities, or Gold), Embassies, \
or relationship pacts such as a Cease-fire or Peace. The list of items that can be traded through diplomacy \
is ruleset dependent. There is no need to trade like for like; you can trade, say, an Advance or City for \
Gold, you can consider this buying and selling. Each player builds a list of offered items. To remove an \
item from the list, double-click on it. When both players indicate satisfaction, the pact is concluded.\
"), _("\
Pacts affect where your Units can go and what they can do, and a pact with one nation can affect your \
relations with others. Under authoritarian governments such as Monarchy you can break a pact at any time, \
but the representative governments (Republic and Democracy) have a Senate which will block the unprovoked \
cancellation of a treaty, unless a foreign Diplomat or Spy sparks a diplomatic incident. The only way to \
dissolve a pact in this situation is to dissolve your government by going into Anarchy. The details of pacts \
are described in the Diplomacy section.\
"), _("\
A few notes:\n\
  1. You cannot give away your capital.\n\
  2. You can only request property that you know about; so you cannot request Technology unless you have an \
Embassy, and if you cannot see a City on your Map, then you cannot request it. Of course, the owner of that \
City can still offer it to you, in which case the area around the City is shown on your Map before you accept \
the treaty.\n\
  3. One important thing to note: when a City is transferred, any Units in the field and supported by that \
City are also transferred, except those sitting in other Cities. So make sure the other player is not \
getting a better deal than you expect.\
"), _("\
 8. Exploring the World.\
"), _("\
After you have fortified your Cities with troops, build Triremes in the Cities near the sea. Use the \
Triremes to Map the world in search of your opponents and new lands. If you are on an island, you should \
spend less on military and more on expansion. Or if you are located close to an opponent, it is truly a good \
idea to make a Peace treaty and share the Advances you have made. Diplomatic Units are very useful here, and \
WILL pay off later.\
"), _("\
 9. Things to keep in mind.\
"), _("\
  - What the next Advance you will need is.\n\
  - What your Tax, Luxury and Research rates are currently set to.\n\
  - Treaties are often broken, so do not neglect defense!\n\
  - Some Wonders can be made obsolete by a new Technology.\
"), _("\
 10. Making your own strategy for the game.\
"), _("\
These basic concepts will allow you to play the game pretty well, especially in the beginning of the game. \
To improve, you need to study the various Units and Advances, and PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE! Freeciv21 \
has many twists, so if you have not played a similar game before, try consulting the Freeciv21 \
documentation pages at:\

[help_terrain]
name = _("Terrain")
text = _("\
Terrain serves three roles: the theater upon which your Units battle rival Civilizations, the landscape \
across which your Units travel, and the medium which your Cities manage to produce resources. The different \
types of terrain each have different strengths and drawbacks. See the sections on each terrain type for \
details.\
"), _("\
Terrain affects combat very simply: when a Unit is attacked, its defense strength is multiplied by the \
defense factor (\"Bonus\") of the terrain beneath it. Some types of Units do not enjoy this bonus. In the \
classic ruleset, only land Units do. See the help section on Combat for further details.\
"), _("\
Terrain can complicate the movement of Units. For instance, in the classic ruleset, moving onto rough \
terrain such as Mountains can cost land Units more than flat terrain like Plains, although sea and air Units \
always expend one movement point to move one Tile. Different rulesets will change the way and amount of \
move points that are expended based on the terrain.\
"), _("\
Tiles within range of a City may be managed by that City to produce Food, Production, and Trade points. The \
quantity of each produced depends on the terrain. These three products are so important that we specify \
the output of a Tile simply by listing them with slashes in between: for example, \"1/2/0\" describes a Tile \
that each turn when it is being managed by a City Citizen produces one Food point, two Production points, \
and no Trade points. In addition to the characteristic output of the terrain, some Tiles have an additional \
Special resource that boosts one or two of the products. See the Economy section for more information on the \
use of these products.\
"), _("\
The net benefit of a Tile for your City depends on your form of government as well as City Improvements, \
Tile Improvements, and Wonders. NOTE: If you middle-click on a Tile and see a negative value (for example: \
\"3(-1)/1/4(-1)\") this means you are in a form of Government that cannot utilize all of the resources. \
This is often called the Despotism penalty. Learn a new form of government or look for any Wonders that get \
rid of the penalty.\

Certain Units have the ability to alter terrain Tiles in several ways: they may add or remove Tile \
Improvements, remove unwanted features such as Pollution, or change the base terrain type entirely.\
"), _("\
Tile Improvements typically provide some lasting bonus for as long as they are present, such as a Production \
bonus when a City Citizen manages the Tile. Roads or paths typically ease movement if they connect to a \
similar road on an adjacent Tile. Bases often provide protection and refueling. The available Tile \
Improvements are described in the following sections.\
"), _("\
Improvements can be built by issuing one of several orders to a suitable Unit while on a suitable Tile: \
\"Mine\", \"Irrigate\", \"Road\", or \"Build Base\". Whether the order builds an Improvement of the same \
name is up to the ruleset.\
"), _("\
Terrain can sometimes be permanently converted into a type more suitable to the player's needs, although \
this usually takes longer than adding an Improvement. Converting terrain from one type to another in this \
way may destroy existing Improvements if the new terrain is unsuitable, and will also remove access to \
Special resources if they were specific to the original terrain type.\
"), _("\
The requirements for terrain conversion are set by the ruleset. It can be initiated in several ways:\
"), _("\
 - By issuing \"Irrigate\" or \"Mine\" orders when on terrain unsuitable for Tile Improvements.\n\
 - By issuing the special \"Transform\" order. This often causes more radical transformations.\
"), _("\
In some rulesets, Units can even reclaim land from water Tiles, and similarly land can be transformed to \
water, although such radical transformations may require a certain number of surrounding Tiles to already be \
land or water respectively. Units capable of terrain alteration that cannot reach the existing terrain may \
have to be loaded onto a suitable vessel, and if necessary and possible, they will move to safe neighboring \
Tiles when the conversion is complete.\
"), _("\
Units may also be able to destroy terrain alterations, by \"Pillaging\". Typically more kinds of Units can \
pillage an Improvement than could build it in the first place. Some Tile features can only be removed by \
specialized Units, such as the \"Clean Pollution\" or \"Clean Nuclear Fallout\" orders.\
"), _("\
Terrain conversions cannot be undone in this way. For example, in the classic ruleset, if a Forest Tile has \
been irrigated to convert it into Plains, you cannot convert it back into a Forest by pillaging. To do so, \
you would have to convert the Tile again with a suitable Unit.\
"), _("\
The time it takes a Unit to alter terrain depends on its movement rate. The following table shows the number \
of turns required for a Unit with 1 movement point to complete an activity. These numbers are reduced for \
Units with faster move rates, such as Engineers in the classic ruleset. The time taken can be reduced \
further by several Units working together as a team. If two or more Units are working on the same task on \
the same Tile, their efforts will be added together each turn until the task is finished. Be careful not to \
dedicate too many Units to one task though, excess effort can be wasted, and groups of terrain improving \
Units are often vulnerable to enemy attacks.\

into play when there is a diplomatic relationship pact between nations (see the section on Diplomacy).\
"), _("\
Building a City establishes a claim on an area of land around the City. In the classic ruleset, once \
claimed, a Tile that can be directly managed by a City cannot change ownership unless the City does (or is \

such as the relative size of nearby nations' Cities. Other rulesets may differ in which, if any, Tiles are \

enhances this capability). Cities producing more Food than they require accumulate the surplus in their \
Granary. Those producing less than they require deplete their Granary. When Food is needed but none \
remains, the City population starves, killing Units that consume Food first, followed by Citizens, until the \
Food deficit ends.\

Excess Food can increase the population. The City Granary has a limited capacity, and once full the City \
grows by one Citizen and the Granary starts again at empty. Since Granary capacity increases with \

Units appear on the Map and can be kept inside a City. Any leftover Production points remain available to be \
applied towards the next project in the City work list.\

City is of sufficient size. You can allow a City to be disbanded from the City Dialog. However, you cannot \
disband your last City this way.\

In the classic ruleset, a City can build at most one project per turn, regardless of its Production surplus. \
However, in some rulesets, factors such as City size and Technology may enable a single City to produce more \
than one Unit in a single turn under certain conditions. A City with multiple \"Build Slots\", ordered to \
build a Unit, can build as many of that single kind of Unit per turn as its Production surplus allows, up to \
the number of slots. Units which cost City population to build are an exception to this rule. They can only \
be built singly, as can buildings. There is an available column in the Cities View to show \"Build Slots\".\
"), _("\
A City can be given a list of several projects to build in its \"Work List\", avoiding the need to pay \

try to build the last item again if possible. Otherwise it will choose a new target itself. If a City is \
currently producing Gold (building Coinage in the classic rules), an activity which never completes, putting \
an item on its work list will cause it to stop producing Gold and start working on the new item next turn. \
In rulesets which permit it, a City may take several Units of the same type off its work list in a single \

Zones of control are only enforceable on some terrain. In the classic rules only on land Tiles. When ZOC \
applies, the general rule is that a Unit which is adjacent to an enemy occupied Tile cannot move directly to \
another Tile which is also adjacent to an enemy occupied Tile. An enemy occupied Tile is one with a foreign \
Unit of a type that imposes ZOC, unless you have an Alliance pact with that nation. Adjacency means any of \
the eight Tiles surrounding a Unit for rectangular grids, or six Tiles for hexagonal grids.\

land Unit disembarking from a boat which is on an Ocean Tile.\n\

is empty.\

TIP: You can infiltrate enemy zones by first moving in a Diplomat (or some other Unit which ignores ZOC), \

                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\
                     Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\
\n\
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\
\n\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this \
license document, but changing it is not allowed.\
\n\n\
Preamble\
\n\n\
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for \
software and other kinds of works.\
\n\n\
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed \
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, \
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom \
to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains \
free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the \
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to \
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to \
your programs, too.\
\n\n\
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. \
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the \
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if \
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, \
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, \
and that you know you can do these things.\
\n\n\
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these \
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain \
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify \
it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\
\
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or \
for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. \
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you \
must show them these terms so they know their rights.\
\n\n\
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: \
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License \
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\
\n\n\
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains \
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and \
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, \
so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of \
previous versions.\
\n\n\
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified \
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. \
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom \
to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the \
area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is \
most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL \
to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise \
substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision \
to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the \
freedom of users.\
\n\n\
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States \
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on \
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the \
special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it \
effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents \
cannot be used to render the program non-free.\
\n\n\
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\
\n\n\
TERMS AND CONDITIONS\
0. Definitions.\
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\
\n\n\
“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of \
works, such as semiconductor masks.\
\n\n\
“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. \
Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be \
individuals or organizations.\
\n\n\
To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a \
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. \
The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work \
“based on” the earlier work.\
\n\n\
A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\
\n\n\
To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, \
would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable \
copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. \
Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), \
making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\
\n\n\
To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties \
to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, \
with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\
\n\n\
An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent \
that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays \
an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no \
warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), \
that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a \
copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands \
or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\
\n\n\
1. Source Code.\
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making \
modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\
\n\n\
A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard \
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified \
for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers \
working in that language.\
\n\n\
The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the \
work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major \
Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only \
to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard \
Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code \
form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component \
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) \
on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, \
or an object code interpreter used to run it.\
\n\n\
The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the \
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) \
run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control \
those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, \
or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are \
used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of \
the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition \
files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for \
shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is \
specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication \
or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\
\n\n\
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate \
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\
\n\n\
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\
\n\n\
2. Basic Permissions.\
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright \
on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. \
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified \
Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only \
if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License \
acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\
\n\n\
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without \
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey \
covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications \
exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, \
provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material \
for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered \
works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, \
on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside \
their relationship with you.\
\n\n\
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions \
stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\
\n\n\
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective Technological measure under \
any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright \
treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting \
circumvention of such measures.\
\n\n\
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid \
circumvention of Technological measures to the extent such circumvention \
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered \
work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the \
work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' \
legal rights to forbid circumvention of Technological measures.\
\n\n\
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, \
in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each \
copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this \
License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to \
the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give \
all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\
\n\n\
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and \
you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\
\n\n\
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to \
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms \
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\
\n\n\
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, \
and giving a relevant date.\
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released \
under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This \
requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to \
anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore \
apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole \
of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This \
License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it \
does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display \
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive \
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work \
need not make them do so.\
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent \
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, \
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, \
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \
“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not \
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users \
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work \
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other \
parts of the aggregate.\
\n\n\
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms \
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable \
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\
\n\n\
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product \
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the \
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily \
used for software interchange.\
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product \
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written \
offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer \
spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone \
who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding \
Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, \
on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for \
a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this \
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from \
a network server at no charge.\
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written \
offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed \
only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the \
object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place \
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding \
Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You \
need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with \
the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, \
the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a \
third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain \
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding \
Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain \
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these \
requirements.\
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform \
other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being \
offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from \
the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying \
the object code work.\
\n\n\
A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible \
personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household \
purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. \
In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall \
be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a \
particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that \
class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the \
way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected \
to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether \
the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, \
unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\
\n\n\
“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, \
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute \
modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified \
version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure \
that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case \
prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\
\n\n\
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or \
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as \
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the \
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a \
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the \
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by \
the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if \
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified \
object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been \
installed in ROM).\
\n\n\
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a \
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates \
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for \
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to \
a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and \
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules \
and protocols for communication across the network.\
\n\n\
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, \
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly \
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source \
code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, \
reading or copying.\
\n\n\
7. Additional Terms.\
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this \
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. \
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall \
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent \
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply \
only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those \
permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without \
regard to the additional permissions.\
\n\n\
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove \
any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. \
(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal \
in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional \
permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you \
have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\
\n\n\
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material \
you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright \
holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\
\n\n\
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the \
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices \
or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal \
Notices displayed by works containing it; or\
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, \
or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in \
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors \
or authors of the material; or\
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some \
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that \
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions \
of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, \
for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly \
impose on those licensors and authors.\
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further \
restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as \
you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that \
it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further \
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains \
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this \
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms \
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does \
not survive such relicensing or conveying.\
\n\n\
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, \
you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the \
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating \
where to find the applicable terms.\
\n\n\
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in \
the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; \
the above requirements apply either way.\
\n\n\
8. Termination.\
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly \
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or \
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights \
under this License (including any patent licenses granted under \
the third paragraph of section 11).\
\n\n\
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your \
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, \
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your \
license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of \
the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\
\n\n\
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated \
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by \
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice \
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, \
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\
\n\n\
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the \
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under \
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently \
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material \
under section 10.\
\n\n\
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a \
copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring \
solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a \
copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than \
this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered \
work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. \
Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your \
acceptance of this License to do so.\
\n\n\
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically \
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and \
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible \
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\
\n\n\
An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an \
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, \
or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an \
entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of \
the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor \
in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to \
possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in \
interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\
\n\n\
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights \
granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a \
license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under \
this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim \
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed \
by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or \
any portion of it.\
\n\n\
11. Patents.\
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License \
of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed \
is called the contributor's “contributor version”.\
\n\n\
A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or \
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, \
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, \
using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would \
be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor \
version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant \
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\
\n\n\
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent \
license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, \
offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents \
of its contributor version.\
\n\n\
In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement \
or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express \
permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). \
To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement \
or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\
\n\n\
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the \
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of \
charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network \
server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the \
Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself \
of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, \
in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the \
patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have \
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered \
work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, \
would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have \
reason to believe are valid.\
\n\n\
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, \
you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant \
a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing \
them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, \
then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients \
of the covered work and works based on it.\
\n\n\
A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope \
of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise \
of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. \
You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a \
third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you \
make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying \
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would \
receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection \
with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), \
or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that \
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent \
license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\
\n\n\
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied \
license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to \
you under applicable patent law.\
\n\n\
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) \
that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the \
conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy \
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, \
then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to \
terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to \
whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and \
this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\
\n\n\
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link \
or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero \
General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. \
The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered \
work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section \
13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\
\n\n\
14. Revised Versions of this License.\
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU \
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in \
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems \
or concerns.\
\n\n\
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies \
that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later \
version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions \
either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free \
Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU \
General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free \
Software Foundation.\
\n\n\
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU \
General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of \
a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\
\n\n\
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, \
no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result \
of your choosing to follow a later version.\
\n\n\
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. \
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES \
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR \
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY \
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND \
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU \
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\
\n\n\
16. Limitation of Liability.\
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL \
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM \
AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, \
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE \
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE \

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above \
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts \
shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all \
civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption \
of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\
