============================
Freeciv21 graphics materials
============================

This directory contains material (such as 3D models) that was
originally used to prepare some of the graphics distributed with
Freeciv21.

These files may be of use in preparing modified versions of those
graphics, but they are not required to build Freeciv21 from source, and
there is no automated process by which the distributed graphics can be
rebuilt from these files; they are provided for reference.

They are are not included in the main source distribution due to their
size.
