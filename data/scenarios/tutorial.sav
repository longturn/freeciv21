Lastly, Warriors are a really cheap early military unit that can be used for basic defense of your cities as well as attacking your enemies. Refer to the Help -> Units topic.

If you do not see a small map on the lower right of your screen you can activate it from the View Menu and then select Minimap. The minimap can be used to quickly get around the main map by right-clicking in the window with your mouse and the main map will quickly scroll to that spot. Something similar can be used for units. When a unit is active it will show in a controls bar at the bottom of the screen, but you may not see it in the map.
