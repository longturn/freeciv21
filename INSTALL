Installing Freeciv21:
=====================

This file describes how to compile and install Freeciv21. Last time we made sure this file is up to date was 14-Feb-21. Last major
update was 14-Feb-21.

0. Prerequisites:
=================

Freeciv21 has a number of prerequisites.  Note, that apart from the first prerequisite, the Freeciv21 configuration process is smart
enough to work out whether your system is suitable.  If in doubt, just try it.

 - An operating system that support Qt.

Any modern operating system that support Qt is required. As of this writing this is Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. On Windows both
Msys2 and Cygwin are supported. However, Msys2 is more supported by the Freeciv21 team.

 - A C and C++ 14 compiler.

Freeciv21 is written in very portable C and C++.  Both 32- and 64-bit machines are supported.  You cannot use a "K&R
C" compiler, or a C++ compiler. The C++ compiler must support C++ 14.

Development of Freeciv21 is primarily done with "gcc", the GNU project's excellent C and C++ compiler. Microsoft Windows MS Visual C
support is under development.

 - A "cmake" program.

   Freeciv21 developers generally use "cmake", the Kitware make program.

   You can check if you have GNU make installed on your system by typing:

       % cmake --version

   The output should include "Kitware cmake" somewhere and the version should be >=3.12.

 - Ninja cmake build program

 - libtool version 2.2 or better

 - libsqlite3

   http://www.sqlite.org/

   The git version has additional requirements. A release version contains the generated files.

 - The programs from GNU gettext version 0.15 or better

   Especially the xgettext program is required to create the *.gmo files which aren't included in the git tree.

 - libkf5archive

 - libSDL2 Mixer

 - Python 3


1. Prerequisites for the Qt client:
===================================

The Freeciv21 project maintains a single Qt client.

 - C++ compiler.

Qt-client is written in C++, so you need appropriate compiler. In Freeciv21 development, g++ has been used.

 - Qt5Core, Qt5Gui, and Qt5Widgets libraries and headers. At least version 5.11 is required.


2. Compiling and Installing Freeciv21:
======================================

Compiling Freeciv21 requires the use of the cmake program. To build with defaults enter the following commmand from the freeciv21
directory:

   cmake . -B build -G Ninja

To customize the compile, cmake requires the use of command line parameters.  cmake calls them directives and they start with -D.
The defaults are marked with * (e.g. *ON*).

  -DFREECIV_ENABLE_TOOLS={*ON*/OFF}     -- Enables all the tools with one parameter (Ruledit, FCMP, Ruleup, and Manual)
  -DFREECIV_ENABLE_SERVER={*ON*/OFF}    -- Enables the server. Should typically set to ON to be able to play AI games
  -DFREECIV_ENABLE_NLS={*ON*/OFF}       -- Enables Native Language Support
  -DFREECIV_ENABLE_CIVMANUAL={*ON*/OFF} -- Enables the Freeciv Manual application
  -DFREECIV_ENABLE_CLIENT={*ON*/OFF}    -- Enables the Qt client. Should typically set to ON unless you only want the server
  -DFREECIV_ENABLE_FCMP_CLI={ON/OFF}    -- Enables the command line version of the Freeciv21 Modpack Installer
  -DFREECIV_ENABLE_FCMP_QT={ON/OFF}     -- Enables the Qt version of the Freeciv21 Modpack Installer (recommended)
  -DFREECIV_ENABLE_RULEDIT={ON/OFF}     -- Enables the Ruleset Editor
  -DFREECIV_ENABLE_RULEUP={ON/OFF}      -- Enables the Ruleset upgrade tool
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE={*Release*/Debug}  -- Changes the Build Type. Most people will pick Release
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path     -- Allows an alternative install path. Default is /usr/local/share/freeciv21

For more information on other cmake directives see https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-variables.7.html.

Once the command line directives are determined, the appropriate command looks like this:

   cmake . -B build -G Ninja \
     -DFREECIV_ENABLE_TOOLS=OFF \
     -DFREECIV_ENABLE_SERVER=ON \
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
     -DFREECIV_ENABLE_NLS=OFF \
     -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/Install/Freeciv21

Once the build files have been written, then compile with this command:

   cmake --build build

Once the compilation is complete, install the game with this command.

   cmake --install build

   NOTE: If you did not change the default install prefix, you will need to elevate privileges with sudo.

After compilation, the important results are:

  - The "build/freeciv-qt" and "build/freeciv-server" binaries.
  - The "build/data/" directory, which contains the graphics and scenarios.

See the README file for more information.


3. Debian Linux Notes:
======================

Below are all the command line steps needed to start with a fresh install of Debian or its variants (e.g. Ubuntu, Linux Mint) to
install Freeciv21.

Start with ensuring your have a source repository (deb-src) turned on in apt sources and then run the following commands.

   sudo apt update

   sudo apt build-dep freeciv

   sudo apt install git \
     cmake \
     ninja-build \
     python3 \
     qt5-default \
     libkf5archive-dev \
     libmagickwand-dev \
     libsdl2-mixer-dev \
     libunwind-dev \
     libdw-dev

   mkdir -p $HOME/GitHub

   cd $HOME/GitHub

   git clone https://github.com/longturn/freeciv21.git

   cd freeciv21

At this point follow the steps in section 2 above.


4. Windows notes:
=================

Msys2 is an available environment for compiling Freeciv21. Microsoft Windows Visual C is under development.

Freeciv21 currently supports building and installing using the Msys2 environment. Build instructions for
Msys2 versions are documented in doc/README.msys2. Alternately you can visit
https://github.com/jwrober/freeciv-msys2 for ready make scripts.

Follow the steps in Chapter 2. Compiling and Installing Freeciv21.

Instead of using this command to install and create the Windows Installer:

    cmake --build build --target package

When the Ninja command is finished running, you will find an installer in build/Windows-${arch}
