Authentication and Database Support (fcdb)
******************************************

The Freeciv21 server allows the authentication of users, although by default it is not configured, and anyone
can connect with any username.

In order to support authentication, the Freeciv21 server needs access to a database backend in which to store
the credentials. To support different database backends, the database access code is written in Lua using
luasql. In principle, luasql supports SQLite3, MySQL, and Postgres backends. However, the Freeciv21 server is
only built with SQLite3 and the provided :file:`database.lua` is also only programmed to support SQLite3.

As well as storing and retrieving usernames and passwords, the supplied database access script logs the time
and IP address of each attempted login, although this information is not used by the Freeciv21 server itself.

To use the Freeciv21 database and authentication, the server must be installed properly, as it searches for
:file:`database.lua` in the :file:`$HOME/.config/freeciv21` directory. The server cannot simply be run from a
build directory if authentication is required.

Quick Setup: SQLite
===================

The simplest setup is to use the SQLite3 backend, and this is probably the best option for new deployments. In
this setup, the authentication data is stored in a simple file accessed directly by the Freeciv21 server.
There is no need for a separate database server process.

To set this up, first create a database configuration file called something like :file:`fc_auth.conf`, with
the ``database`` key specifying where the database file is to live. It must be readable and writable by the
Freeciv21 server. A good default location is the user's :file:`$HOME` directory. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [fcdb]
    backend="sqlite"
    database="/my/path/to/freeciv21.sqlite"


For more information on the format of this file, see below. There are more settings available, but this file
is entirely sufficient for a SQLite3 setup.

Now we need some software and Lua scripts installed on the server to support the SQLite3 database as well as
storing passwords with MD5 hashes.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ sudo apt install luarocks
    $ sudo luarocks --lua-version 5.3 install md5
    $ sudo luarocks --lua-version 5.3 install luasql-sqlite3


Lastly, we need to download the :file:`database.lua` script file.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ mkdir -p $HOME/.config/freeciv21
    $ cd $HOME/.config/freeciv21
    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longturn/freeciv21/master/lua/database.lua


Now start the server with:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ freeciv21-server --Database ~/fc_auth.conf --auth --Newusers


The first time you do this, you need to create the database file and its tables with the following server
command:

.. code-block:: rst

    /fcdb lua sqlite_createdb()


Now you can create some users by connecting with the client. Due to the :code:`--Newusers` flag, when you
connect with the client with a previously unknown username, the server will prompt for a password and save the
new account to the database.

You may want to prepopulate the users table this way and then restart the server without :code:`--Newusers`
for the actual game, or you can run the game with :code:`--Newusers`.

Advanced SQLite Usage
---------------------

SQLite supports working with a temporary database in memory which is never written to disk. To do this,
specify :code:`database=":memory:"` in the configuration file. The database will last only for the lifetime of
the ``freeciv21-server`` process. Its contents will be lost if the server quits or crashes. It is not saved in
the saved game file, either. You will probably need the :code:`--Newusers` option.

Command-line Options
====================

The following server command-line options are relevant to authentication:

* :code:`-D` or :code:`--Database <conffile>`: Specifies a configuration file describing how to connect to
  the database. Without this, all authentication will fail.
* :code:`-a` or :code:`--auth`: Enable authentication. Without this, anyone will be able to connect without
  authentication, and :code:`--Database` has no effect.
* :code:`-G` or :code:`--Guests`: Allow guests. These are usernames with names starting with "guest". If
  enabled, any number of guests may connect without accounts in the database. If a guest name is already in
  use by a connection, a new guest name is generated. Once connected, guests have the same privileges as any
  other account. If this option is not specified, accounts are required to connect, and guest account names
  are forbidden.
* :code:`-N` or :code:`--Newusers`: Allow Freeciv21 clients to create new user accounts through the Freeciv21
  protocol. Without this, only accounts which already exist in the database can connect. This might be
  desirable if you wants users to register via a web front end, for instance.

Lua script database.lua
=======================

This script is responsible for checking usernames, fetching passwords, and saving new users (if
:code:`--Newusers` is enabled). It encapsulates access to the database backend, and hence the details of the
table layout.

The script lives in :file:`lua/database.lua` in the source tree. Instructions above place the file into
:file:`$HOME/.config/freeciv21`.

The supplied version supports basic authentication against a SQLite3 database. It supports configuration as
shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [fcdb]
    backend="sqlite"
    host="localhost"
    user="Freeciv21"
    port="3306"
    password="s3krit"
    database="Freeciv21"
    table_user="auth"
    table_log="loginlog"


If that is sufficient for you, it is not necessary to read on. Freeciv21 expects the following lua functions
to be defined in :file:`database.lua`:

* Try to load data for an existing user.
* Return ``TRUE`` if the user exists, ``FALSE`` otherwise in function :code:`user_load(conn)`.
* Save a new user to the database in function :code:`user_save(conn)`.
* Log the connection attempt (success is boolean) in function :code:`user_log(conn, success)`.
* Test and initialise the database connection in function :code:`database_init()`.
* Free the database connection in function :code:`database_free()`.

Where ``conn`` is on object representing the connection to the client which requests access.

The return status of all of these functions should be one of:

.. code-block:: rst

    fcdb.status.ERROR
    fcdb.status.TRUE
    fcdb.status.FALSE


indicating an error, a positive result, or a negative result. The following lua functions are provided by
Freeciv21:

* Return the client-specified username in function :code:`auth.get_username(conn)`.
* Return the client IP address (string) in function :code:`auth.get_ipaddr(conn)`.
* Tell the server (the MD5 hash of) the correct password to check against.
* For this connection (usually to be called by function :code:`user_load()`).
* Returns whether this succeeded in function :code:`auth.set_password(conn, password)`.
* Return (the MD5 hash of) the password for this connection (as specified by the client in in function
  :code:`user_save()`, or as previously set by the function :code:`set_password()`.
* The function :code:`auth.get_password(conn)` runs.
* Return a value from the :code:`--Database` configuration file in function :code:`fcdb.option(type)`.

``type`` selects one of the entries in the configuration file by name (for instance the function
:code:`fcdb.option("backend")`).

Freeciv21 also provides some of the same Lua functions that ruleset scripts get: ``log.*()``, ``_()``, etc.,
but the script is executing in a separate context from ruleset scripts, and does not have access to signals,
game data, etc.
