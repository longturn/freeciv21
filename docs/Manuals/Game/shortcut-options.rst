  Shortcut Options Dialog


To override the default (e.g. change a shortcut setting), click your mouse cursor on the box on the right and
then type the shortcut you want to set the setting to. For example: You want to change the
:guilabel:`Scroll Map` option to the :guilabel:`PgUp` key, you would click in the box and then press the
:guilabel:`PgUp` key on your keyboard. To reset to defaults, you can click on the :guilabel:`Reset` button.
Click :guilabel:`Save` and then :guilabel:`Close` when finished.

In most cases, the keyboard shortcut will also show on an associated menu entry depending on the type of
shortcut.
