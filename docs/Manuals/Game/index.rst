Game Manual
***********

The Freeciv21 Game Client (``freeciv21-client``) is the main user interface that allows one to play single player
and online multiplayer games. This manual will mostly track what is in the ``master`` branch of the Freeciv21
GitHub Repository at https://github.com/longturn/freeciv21/tree/master. You can see the date that this file
was last updated at the bottom of this page in the footer.

If you have not installed Freeciv21, then obviously you need to start :doc:`there </Getting/install>`.

If you are having trouble, come find the Longturn Community on Discord at https://discord.gg/98krqGm. A good
place to start is the ``#questions-and-answers`` channel.
