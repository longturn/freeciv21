  Messages are essentially a visual response to an event that occur during a turn or turn change in a game.

The column headings do the following:

* :strong:`Out` -- The event message will be placed into the :guilabel:`Server Chat/Command Line` widget on
  the main map.
* :strong:`Mes` -- The event message will be placed into the :guilabel:`Messages` widget as described in
  :ref:`Messages <client-manual-messages-button>`.
* :strong:`Pop` -- The event message will be displayed in a pop-up message box.

The following is a detailed view of all of the message options available in Freeciv21. Each entry provides
a short description of the message, the default setting and the name of the event.
