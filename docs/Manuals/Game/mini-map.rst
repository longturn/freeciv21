Minimap
*******

There is a :guilabel:`Minimap` widget in the lower right corner of the :ref:`Map View <game-manual-map-view>`.
:numref:`Minimap Single Player Widget` below shows an example of the :guilabel:`Minimap` widget for a single
player game. :numref:`Minimap Multiplayer Widget` shows an example of of the :guilabel:`Minimap` widget for a
Longturn multiplayer game with a fixed turn length. The difference between the two is the single player
:guilabel:`Turn Done` button is replaced with a countdown timer. On the right hand side of the
:guilabel:`Minimap` are zoom buttons similar to what you would find in the
:ref:`View Menu <game-manual-view-menu>`. Inside of the :guilabel:`Minimap` you will see an area inside a
white border. This is the portion of the whole :ref:`Map View <game-manual-map-view>` that is displayed on the
screen. Right-clicking inside the :guilabel:`Minimap` will cause the :ref:`Map View <game-manual-map-view>` to
move to that spot. The :guilabel:`Minimap` provides a quick way to move around a large map in this manner.

You can also resize the :guilabel:`Minimap` widget by dragging from the top or left sides.
