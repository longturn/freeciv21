Freeciv21 is a turn-based strategy game, in which each player becomes the leader of a civilization. You
compete against several opponents to build cities, use them to support a military and economy, and finally
to complete an empire that survives all encounters with its neighbors to emerge victorious. Each opponent
may be either another human or controlled by the computer. All players begin at the dawn of history in 4,000
BCE with a handful of units. Depending on the ruleset selected this is typically an :unit:`Explorer` and a
couple of :unit:`Settlers`. The race then begins to expand outward from those humble beginnings.

Achieving success requires a balance between economic expansion, military strength, and technological
development. Not only must you develop all three in concert to both expand and successfully defend your
empire, but any of these four items may provide victory over your opponents:

* As in other games of conquest and expansion, you are declared the winner by default once the last city and
  unit of every other civilization is destroyed.
* Once technological progress has brought you into the space age, you may launch a spaceship destined for
  Alpha Centauri. The first civilization whose spaceship reaches the system wins.
* In the absence of other means to determine victory, the game will end after 5,000 turns if no spaceships
  have been launched. The surviving civilizations are then rated, and the one with the highest score is
  the winner.
* If playing a multiplayer game with only humans, victory can be declared based on diplomatic factors and
  other pre-set game rules.

.. note:: Spacerace Victory is set by the ruleset and thereby may not be not enabled for all games.
