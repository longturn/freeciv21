Welcome to the Freeciv21 manual
*******************************

Welcome to the documentation of the Freeciv21 project brought to you by the
`longturn.net <https://longturn.net>`_ community. The documentation is organized in six categories:

:doc:`Getting <Getting/index>`
  The Getting category is where you to go learn about Freeciv21 and how to get it installed on your system.

:doc:`Playing <Playing/index>`
  The Playing category is an area for documentation editors to provide tips and tricks on ways to play
  Freeciv21 and any of they varying rulesets that the longurn.net community likes to play. You will also find
  the FAQ here.

:doc:`Manuals <Manuals/index>`
  The Manuals category is where we place all of our varying manuals such as the game manual, advanced user
  manual and ruleset manuals.

:doc:`Modding <Modding/index>`
  The Modding category is an area for documentation editors to provide tips and other details on modifying
  aspects of Freeciv21 such as Rulesets, Musicsets, Soundsets and Tilesets. All of these areas allow for a
  large amount of varyability in game play that is not hardcoded in the software. This is one of the
  strengths of Freeciv21.

:doc:`Contributing <Contributing/index>`
  The Contributing category is where documentation editors provide instructions on how to contribute to the
  Freeciv21 project.

:doc:`Coding <Coding/index>`
  The Coding category is an area for documentation editors to provide information on how to alter the
  source code of Freeciv21.
