Welcome to longturn-manuals's Documentation!
********************************************

Welcome to the longturn.net community Freeciv21 Documentation Project. The documentation is broken into
four categories:

General
  The General category is a catch-all for content that does not neatly fit into the other three. Things like
  the FAQ and installation instructions go here.

Playing
  The Playing category is an area for documentation editors to provide tips and tricks on ways to play
  Freeciv21 and any of they varying rulesets that the longurn.net community likes to play.

Modding
  The Modding category is an area for documentation editors to provide tips and other details on modifying
  aspects of Freeciv21 such as Rulesets, Musicsets, Soundsets and Tilesets. All of these areas allow for a
  large amount of varyability in game play that is not hardcoded in the software. This is one of the
  strengths of Freeciv21.

Contributing
  The Contributing category is where documentation editors provide instructions on how to contribute to the
  Freeciv21 project.

Coding
  The Coding category is an area for documentation editors to provide information on how to alter the
  source code of Freeciv21.
