Developing
**********

The Developing category is an area for documentation editors to provide information on how to alter the
source code of Freeciv21 and contribute to the project in general. The documentation is split into two
categories: Contributing and Coding.

Contributing
============

This developing category concentrates on the ways to contribute to the Freeciv21 project. Documentation here
is for all types of people: New coders/modders, experienced coders/modders, and project administrators.

Coding
======

This developing category concentrates on the Freeciv21 code itself. Freeciv21 is derived (forked) from the
long standing freeciv open source project, which means that there is a lot of old code that needs
documentation. Many of the documentation below comes from the legacy freeciv project.
