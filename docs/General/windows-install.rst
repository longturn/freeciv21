The following steps assume you :emphasis:`are` logged on as a local Administrator. If you :emphasis:`are
not` then jump to the non-admin_ section below.

If you :emphasis:`are` logged on as a local Administrator, a Windows User Access Control (UAC) window will
appear and ask: "Do you want to allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your device".
Click :guilabel:`Yes` and the welcome panel will load after an uncompress process has completed.
