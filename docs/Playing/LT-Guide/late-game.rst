The Late-Game Strategy
***********************


The late game is generally considered any turn where most (if not all) of the players have progressed to the
7th level of the technology tree (e.g. :advance:`Metallurgy`, :advance:`Steam Engine`, :advance:`Explosives`.
and :advance:`Leadership`). This is where things can get really interesting.

Diplomacy
=========

At this juncture of the game, if you have not determined who your friends are and who your enemies are, then
you are in trouble. While there is no requirement to formally declare an in-game alliance, you should have
already started discussions with other players about combined or shared plans. Most players that survive this
long are good players and will also have developed alliance plans.

.. note::
  Every Longturn game has different alliance victory rules and conditions, so make sure you are aligned with
  those rules before getting carried away.

City and Terrain Management
===========================

If your form of government is not Diplomacy or Federation and you do not have the mass majority of your cities
celebrating, then you are behind. By the time you have learned all of the Level 6 technologies you should have
many cities already celebrating. The Gold and Luxury output will greatly boost your gold per turn
(:term:`GPT`) and bulbs per turn (:term:`BPT`) capacities. You can rush-buy buildings at this stage if you
planned things right. Gold ends up being your production “super power” at this stage of the game.

Keep those :unit:`Workers` going. Get a :improvement:`Sewer System` in your cities so they can grow bigger
than size 16. Once you learn :advance:`Explosives`, you can either use gold to upgrade the :unit:`Workers` to
:unit:`Engineers` or allow :wonder:`Leonardo’s Workshop` to do it for you. Every tile should be grassland by
now (or at least the majority of them). Use :unit:`Engineers` to cut down Mountains and Hills (ones without a
special on them). Use the :unit:`Engineers` to get rid of Desert tiles (ones without a special on them). This
is the time of the game where the majority of your cities should be at :math:`+20` food and growing every turn.

This is also a time in the game where pollution can cause Global Warming. In :term:`LTT` and :term:`LTX`
games, Global Warming is very powerful and can wreak havoc on your growth plans. Keep tiles clear of pollution
as best you can.

.. tip::
  :unit:`Transports` can clean pollution from shallow and deep ocean tiles. Best to put them with a defender
  as they are sitting ducks to your enemies.

.. note::
  Do not be surprised if you see other players ignoring their pollution. This is a known strategy to force
  Global Warming on everyone. You can certainly attempt to get them to clean up, but do not be surprised if
  they ignore you.

.. tip::
  With :unit:`Engineers`, you can turn a city center tile from any type of terrain into Hills. The
  terraforming exercise is very expensive in worker points and will take many turns, even with a large number
  of :unit:`Engineers` working on the same task. However, the defense bonus will make your cities harder to
  capture and also will not be impacted by Global Warming’s effects as badly. It is advised to do this for
  your capital at least.

Research
========

What to research at this point in the game can vary widely depending on what your strategy is with your
alliance. Different players in an alliance can research different paths to specialize. For example, one player
can go for all the sea-going technologies (:advance:`Steam Engine`, :advance:`Railroad`,
:advance:`Engineering`, :advance:`Steel`, :advance:`Combustion`, etc) and develop a very strong Navy. Another
player can concentrate on air-based technologies (:advance:`Flight`, :advance:`Radio`,
:advance:`Advanced Flight`, :advance:`Robotics`, :advance:`Combined Arms`, etc) to build out an Air Force and
a third player can concentrate on a traditional land-based mechanized Army (:advance:`Leadership`,
:advance:`Tactics`, :advance:`Amphibious Warfare`, :advance:`Labor Union`, :advance:`Robotics`, etc.). When it
comes time to defeat your enemies you can work together to bring to force what is needed at the right time.
There is no set prescription this late in the game, you will have to use your best judgment.
