Final Notes + Victory Declaration
*********************************

Depending on how things have gone for you to this point, you might be ready to declare victory. This is one of
the really great features of an :term:`LTT`/:term:`LTX` game; you do not actually have to kill off your
enemies completely with total domination. You and your alliance can severely wound or cripple your enemy
without actually destroying them to a point where your production capabilities greatly outweigh theirs and the
game essentially is over at that point.

Victory declaration occurs on our Longturn Discord Server (https://discord.gg/98krqGm). Each game has a
dedicated ``Ongoing Games`` channel. Opposing teams have 5 days (:math:`5\times24\text{h}`) to oppose. Notice
that this is technically more than 5 typical turns (:math:`5\times23\text{h}`) and shorter than our newer
turn change cycle of 25h.

We used to use an old Forum site (https://forum.longturn.net/), but have moved away from it in favor of
Discord.

As a final conclusion â€“ remember, :strong:`this is a game` and the Longturn Community values good
sportsmanship as much as we do anything else. Have a good time, play to win, lose with grace, and make some
friends.

See you next game!
