Turn 20+: Mid-Game Strategy
***************************

The Path to Democracy
=====================

While you are filling in the map with as many cities as you can, you are going to be developing your empire
by terraforming tiles and adding infrastructure with :unit:`Workers` and at some point it will be necessary to
add happiness buildings as well. Once you research :advance:`Monarchy` or :advance:`Republic` and take the two
turns of Anarchy to change governments you will really see a change in output of all of your cities due to the
elimination of the Despotism penalty.

.. note::
  As a reminder, you can also get rid of the Despotism penalty with the :wonder:`Pyramids` Small Wonder if
  that fits your strategy better. However, at some point you **must** get to Democracy.

You should research the following technologies (not necessarily in this order):

* :advance:`Currency` --- Gives :improvement:`Marketplace` improvement, which increases the luxury and tax
  output in a city by 50%.

* :advance:`Writing` --- Gives :improvement:`Library` improvement, which increases the science output in a
  city by 50%, or by 100% once the :wonder:`Great Library` Great Wonder has been built by any player.

* :advance:`Seafaring` --- Gives :improvement:`Harbor` improvement, which gives one extra food resource on all
  Ocean or Deep Ocean tiles (but not Lakes).

* :advance:`Construction` --- Gives regular :improvement:`Aqueduct` for those cities not near fresh water to
  get them bigger than size 8.

* :advance:`Monotheism` --- Gives the :improvement:`Cathedral` improvement, which makes 3 unhappy citizens
  content in a city.

* :advance:`Bridge Building` --- Allows your :unit:`Workers` to put roads everywhere, especially rivers. This
  is an important task for all of your :unit:`Workers`. You get an extra trade point for a road on a river
  tile.

* :advance:`Feudalism` --- For the :unit:`Pikemen` unit. Your first really good defender. With a
  :improvement:`Barracks` and the :wonder:`Sun Tzu’s War Academy` Small Wonder you can produce vv
  :unit:`Pikemen`. :unit:`Phalanx` can be upgraded to :unit:`Pikemen` as well.

* :advance:`University` --- Gives the :improvement:`University` improvement, which increases the science
  output in a city by an additional 50% (in addition to what the :improvement:`Library` is doing), or by
  100% once :wonder:`Isaac Newton's College` Great Wonder has been built by any player.

* :advance:`Banking` --- Gives the :improvement:`Bank` improvement, which increases the luxury and tax output
  in a city by an additional 30%. With both a :improvement:`Bank` and a :improvement:`Marketplace` in a city,
  the total bonus is 80%.

* :advance:`Invention` --- Gives the two workshop wonders. If someone else gets :wonder:`Verrocchio’s Workshop`
  you should still build the :wonder:`Leonardo’s Workshop`.

* :advance:`Economics` --- Gives the :improvement:`Mercantile Exchange` improvement and also allows for the
  Federation form of government. :improvement:`Mercantile Exchange` increases the luxury and tax output in a
  city by an additional 30%. With a :improvement:`Mercantile Exchange`, a :improvement:`Bank` and a
  :improvement:`Marketplace` in a city, the total bonus is 110%!

* :advance:`Democracy` --- Allows for the Democracy form of government.

* :advance:`Gunpowder` --- For the :unit:`Musketeer` unit. Your second-level, really good defender.
  :unit:`Warriors` and :unit:`Archers` can be upgraded to :unit:`Musketeers`.

* :advance:`Sanitation` --- Gives the :improvement:`Sewer System` improvement. This allows your cities to get
  bigger than size 16.


Getting your Cities to Celebrate
================================

While you are researching the list given above, you need to work to get all the happiness and luxury buildings
constructed in your cities as it makes sense.

.. note::
  Cities size 3 or smaller cannot celebrate. Also at this small size you get very little effect from all the
  happiness and lux buildings anyway, so it makes sense that small cities will not celebrate.


You need to eventually get the following buildings inside your largest cities:

* :improvement:`Temple` → :improvement:`Cathedral`
* :improvement:`City Walls`
* :improvement:`Courthouse`
* :improvement:`Library` → :improvement:`University`
* :improvement:`Marketplace` → :improvement:`Bank` → :improvement:`Mercantile Exchange`

You must have :improvement:`Temples` in all of your cities at a minimum before you switch to Republic or
Democracy or you will have disorder on your hands all over. Ideally you would have :improvement:`Temple`,
:improvement:`City Walls`, :improvement:`Courthouse`, and :improvement:`Marketplace`, along with all the Small
Wonders that enhance them before you switch to Republic or Democracy.

With all this in place, you will want to now get your largest cities (ideally all of them, but it is not
always possible to do that) to celebrate. To accomplish this is a multi-part process:

* Ensure you have :improvement:`Temple`, :improvement:`City Walls`, :improvement:`Courthouse`,
  :improvement:`Marketplace`, and a :improvement:`Bank` inside the city.

* Even better if you can get :improvement:`Mercantile Exchange` in there as well.

* :improvement:`Amphitheater` and/or :improvement:`Cathedral` help with the happiness aspect as well and are
  needed for cities larger than size 16.

* Change the global Lux value to 30%.

* Manipulate the citizens in your cities and convert them to Entertainers (yes this will stall growth). As you
  add Entertainers the content citizens will turn happy and if you have enough Lux and Happiness available the
  city will go to “happy” in the city dialog (right panel). You need half of the citizens to be happy for the
  citizens to celebrate.

* The citizens will go from happy to celebrating at :term:`TC`. You will see the effects in your gold and
  science output when this happens.

.. tip::
  You might have to go to 40% global Lux to get the cities to celebrate initially. Once they are celebrating
  you can adjust the global Lux value down and still keep them celebrating. You can use the
  :ref:`Cities view <game-manual-cities-view>` to monitor the situation. Be sure to have the “state” column
  enabled to see the status.


Mid-Game Military
=================

This is the point in the game where some fighting often happens. You are going to be bumping up against your
neighbors, they might have more land than you at this point. Just like with the notes about military
aggression for the early game, any involvement in military conflict is taking away from growth. As with all
things “Longturn”, there are tradeoffs.

A few thoughts about aggression at this stage of the game:

* You cannot declare war on a player you are at peace with if you are in Republic, Democracy, or Federation.
  You have to go into Anarchy and then declare war, which will kill 2 turns of any progress.

  .. note::
    In Monarchy, Despotism, and Tribal you can declare war at will.

* If you are going to go into a hot war with a neighbor, make sure they are smaller than you. If they are
  bigger you have no chance as they can out produce you. Get some help with an ally if it is really necessary
  to invade. Also, if your neighbor is further along in the technology tree than you are, they could easily
  have more advanced defending and attacking units than you do. You really have no chance in this scenario as
  you cannot out produce them and it will take more units than you can produce in a reasonable amount of time
  to kill more advanced defenders. Wisdom over Valor!

* As a general rule of thumb, at this point in the game you still do not have a ton of production capacity
  and it still takes awhile to construct units (or gold to buy them, which could be scarce). If you are going
  to go to war, it is advisable that every city is involved. Every city should be producing units (attackers
  and defenders). If you do not go all “in”, you risk your opponent doing the same in retaliation and taking
  you out of the game as a result.

* Be sure to have your own defenses set up very well. There is an old saying --- a good defense is the best
  offense. This is a team sports phrase, but it works very well in Longturn games.

* Also recall from earlier, cities without :improvement:`City Walls` will lose a citizen for every unit killed
  inside the city, plus one more when you enter the city. Use a :unit:`Diplomat` to investigate cities before
  you go in and attack. If you think you are going to get some beautiful, large city as a result, you may be
  surprised to see ruins instead. At this stage of the game, only ships do not kill citizens for the coastal
  cities.
