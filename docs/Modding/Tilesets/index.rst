Editing Tilesets
****************

Tilesets are a collection of plain text files that are formatted in a particular way in order to create the
graphics layer (e.g. look and feel) of a Freeciv21 game. There is not a specific set of files for Tilesets,
however each :file:`spec` file must be matched to a :file:`.png` image file.
