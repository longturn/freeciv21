Nation_Intelligence
*******************

.. versionadded:: 3.0
    Add the ``+Nation_Intelligence`` option to ``effects.ruleset``.
.. versionchanged:: 3.1
    Removed support for ``Infra Points``.

The ``Nation_Intelligence`` effect controls what kind of information about a foreign nation is visible in the
:ref:`Nations View <game-manual-nations-and-diplomacy-view>`. A value of ``0`` or lower hides the information,
while it becomes visible when the effect evaluates to ``1`` or bigger. For instance, the following effect
repurposes the :wonder:`United Nations` to reveal everyone's secrets to everone else:

.. code-block:: ini

    [effect_united_nations_intelligence]
    type  = "Nation_Intelligence"
    value = 1
    reqs  =
        { "type",     "name",           "range",  "present"
          "Building", "United Nations", "World",  TRUE
        }


The true power of ``Nation_Intelligence``, however, comes from its combined use with ``NationalIntelligence``
requirements. ``NationalIntelligence`` lets you select precisely what is visible to a player. Let us say that
we want a player owning the :wonder:`Marco Polo Embassy` to know the wonders built by any other player it has
ever met. This could be achieved as follows:

.. code-block:: ini

    [effect_marco_polo_intelligence]
    type  = "Nation_Intelligence"
    value = 1
    reqs  =
        { "type",                 "name",                 "range",  "present"
          "NationalIntelligence", "Wonders",              "Local",  TRUE
          "Building",             "Marco Polo's Embassy", "Player", TRUE
          "DiplRel",              "Never met",            "Local",  FALSE
        }


It is important to note that the effect works from the point of view of the player who *sees* the information.
It cannot depend on what the other player does (except when using ``DiplRel`` requirements).

.. note::
    Note the ``Local`` range used in the ``DiplRel`` requirement above. This is very important: if we had used
    ``Player``, the effect would be enabled only once the player has met every other player in the game (no
    player satisfies ``Never met``).

The possible values for ``NationalIntelligence`` requirements are as follows:

Compatibility
=============

For legacy rulesets, the traditional rules are added automatically if the ``Nation_Intelligence`` option is
not requested in ``effects.ruleset``. They are rather complicated; to facilitate porting rulesets, we provide
a ready-made file implementing them. It can be imported directly from within ``effects.ruleset``:

.. code-block:: ini

    *include "default/nation_intelligence_effects.ruleset"


Most shipped rulesets use this technique.
