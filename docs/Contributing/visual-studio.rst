Visual Studio for Windows
*************************

Freeciv21 can be compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio\ |reg| and :file:`clang-cl`. This page will help you
get version 2022 up and running.

.. warning:: Visual Studio and the corresponding dependencies require a great deal of HDD space on your
   computer. Be sure to have at least 80GB of available space before starting this process.


Base Installation
=================

Start by downloading the Community Edition installer from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community.

Double-click the :file:`VisualStudioSetup.exe` file in your Downloads directory and follow the prompts to
get the setup process started. At some point you will be prompted to select the type of workload you want to
install. Select :guilabel:`Desktop development with C++` and :guilabel:`Python Development`. Next click on the
Individual components tab and select the following options: :guilabel:`Git for Windows`,
:guilabel:`C++ Clang Compiler for Windows (13.0.0)`, :guilabel:`C++ Clang-cl for v143 build tools (x64/x86)`,
and :guilabel:`Python 3 64-bit (3.9.7)`.

When ready click :guilabel:`Install`. Depending on your Internet connection speed, this may take a while.

When the installation process is finished you may be presented with a collection of options. You do not need
Visual Studio right now, so best to close everything at this point.

Add Python to the System Path
=============================

Freeciv21 development needs access to a Python Interpreter. This is why we installed it in the section above.
We also need Python for the ``git clang-format`` command used as part of adding a
:ref:`pull request <pull-Request>` to our GitHub  repository. In Windows Explorer look for Python.
As of this writing it is found in :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\Shared\\Python39_64`.
If not found there, look for it in your user profile. For example:
:file:`C:\\Users\\[UserID]\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python39`. Once you know where it is, we can
add it to the system ``%PATH%``.

Open :guilabel:`Advanced System Settings` from :menuselection:`Start Menu --> Settings --> System --> About`.
Click the :guilabel:`Environment Variables` button. In the :guilabel:`System variables` section, select ``Path``
and click :guilabel:`Edit`. Add :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\Shared\\Python39_64`
and :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\Shared\\Python39_64\Scripts`.

Open a PowerShell prompt. You should be able to enter ``python`` at the prompt and the interpreter should
load. You can type ``quit()`` to exit the interpreter.

.. code-block:: sh

    PS C:\Windows\System32> python
    Python 3.9.7 (tags/v3.9.7:1016ef3, Aug 30 2021, 20:19:38) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

Set Up VCPKG
============

:file:`vcpkg` is a library package manager developed by Microsoft. It makes downloading and installing
third-party libraries much easier. Freeciv21 uses :file:`vcpkg` in this way via the manifest file
:file:`vcpkg.json`. Documentation is available here: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg

First, create a directory on your computer to install :file:`vcpkg` into. For example: :file:`C:\\Tools`.
The directory can be anywhere, however the author prefers to :strong:`not` install things in the root of the
:file:`C:\\` drive.

Open an Administrative elevated PowerShell terminal window. The easiest way to do this is to right-click on
the :guilabel:`Start Menu` and select it from the menu: :guilabel:`Windows PowerShell (Admin)`.

.. code-block:: sh

    PS C:\Windows\System32> cd c:\tools
    PS C:\Tools>


Follow these steps to install :file:`vcpkg`. The :file:`setx` command should be altered to be the correct path
that you installed :file:`vcpkg` into. The forward slashes are correct.

.. code-block:: sh

    Tools> git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
    Tools> .\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
    Tools> setx VCPKG_ROOT C:/Tools/vcpkg /M
    Tools> exit


.. warning:: The :file:`vcpkg` website/readme will ask for you to run a :file:`vcpkg integrate install`
  command to fully integrate all the packages installed into Visual Studio. :strong:`Do Not` run this command
  as it actually breaks Visual Studio's ability to find and use the :file:`clang-cl` compiler, which we need.

GitHub
======

The Longturn.net Community uses the online source code control and revision system known as
`GitHub <https://github.com/>`_. To contribute, you will need an account on this platform. There is no cost.

With an account, you can go to the `Longturn <https://github.com/longturn>`_ community repository page and
:strong:`fork` a repository (such as the Freeciv21 repository) to your personal GitHub account. Go to the main
page of the repository you want to fork and you will find a :strong:`fork` button in the upper-right corner.

In order to get code pushed to the forked repository to your local workstation, you need to setup an
SSH key pair to share with GitHub. Follow these
`instructions <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh>`_.

With SSH set up, now it is time to clone the forked repository from your personal GitHub account to a local
copy on your workstation. You can get the appropriate path by going to your forked copy in a browser, click
the code button and then select the SSH option as shown in this sample screenshot:

.. GitHub Clone SSH:
.. figure:: ../_static/images/github_clone_ssh.png
    :align: center
    :height: 250
    :alt: GitHub Clone SSH

    GitHub Clone SSH


Open up Visual Studio. A menu will appear. Go to the very bottom right and click the link to
:strong:`continue without code`. Select :menuselection:`View --> Terminal` to open a terminal in the IDE if
one is not already shown at the bottom. Once you have the proper GitHub path, here is the command to clone
the repository:

.. code-block:: sh

    PS C:\Users\[user]\Source\Repos> git clone git@github.com:[username]/freeciv21.git


This will clone the forked repository to the :file:`C:\\Users\\[User]\\Source\\Repos\\freeciv21` directory on
your computer.

The final repository setup item is to link the original Longturn project repository to your local area on
your computer:

.. code-block:: sh

    Repos> cd freeciv21
    Repos\freeciv21> git remote add upstream https://github.com/longturn/freeciv21.git
    Repos\freeciv21> git fetch upstream
    Repos\freeciv21> git pull upstream master


You will also need to set a couple global configuration settings so :code:`git` knows a bit more about you.

.. code-block:: sh

    freeciv21> git config --global user.email "[email address associated with GitHub]"
    freeciv21> git config --global user.name "[your first and last name]"


Build Visual Studio Solution
============================

Now let us get Visual Studio set up. Select :menuselection:`Git --> Local Repositories --> Open Local Repository`
and then select the :file:`freeciv21` folder. Visual Studio will take a minute to parse the source tree.

Select :menuselection:`File --> Open --> Folder`. Select the :file:`freeciv21` directory and then Visual
Studio will parse the files in there. It can take a few minutes for this to complete. When complete, Visual
Studio will open a :strong:`CMake Overview Pages` tab.

Microsoft provides documentation on CMake in Visual Studio --
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=msvc-170

Qt Visual Studio Tools
======================

There is an available extension called :strong:`Qt Visual Studio Tools`. This extension allows you to use the
Qt Designer and other Qt tools within the Visual Studio IDE. This is especially useful if you want to edit
any of the client :file:`.ui` files.

Start by `downloading <https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer>`_ the installer. Double-click the downloaded
file and login with your Qt account. If you do not have a Qt account, there should be a link in the installer
window to create one. Click :guilabel:`Next`, agree to the GNU License and state that you are an individual,
not a business. Click :guilabel:`Next` and pick to either send or not send usage statistics to Qt.
Click :guilabel:`Next`. Note that installing to :file:`C:\\Qt` is fine. Ensure :guilabel:`Custom Install`
is selected and then click :guilabel:`Next`. On the right, uncheck :guilabel:`latest support release` and
check :guilabel:`LTS`, click :guilabel:`Filter`. Expand :guilabel:`Qt` and check the ``5.15.2`` option. Click
:guilabel:`Next` and agree to the Microsoft license. Click :guilabel:`Next` and note that :strong:`Qt` for
the Start Menu is fine. Click :guilabel:`Next` and :guilabel:`Install` to begin the process.

.. note:: You can reduce the size of the Qt Tools install by expanding the ``5.15.2`` option and unchecking
  ``WebAssembly``, ``MSVC 2015 64-bit``, ``MSVC 2019 32-bit``, ``MinGW 8.1.0 32-bit``, ``MinGW 8.1.0 64-bit``,
  ``UWP*``, and ``Android``. Unless you intend to develop for those platforms, you do not need to download and
  install those components.

To install the extension. In Visual Studio, click on :menuselection:`Extensions --> Manage Extensions --> Online`.
Search for :strong:`Qt Visual Studio Tools` and install it.

To set the version of Qt in the extension's options. Click on
:menuselection:`Extensions --> Qt VS Tools --> Qt Versions`. Add version ``5.15`` and in the path enter:
:file:`C:\\Qt\\5.15.2\\msvc2019_64\\bin`.

Final Steps and Notes
=====================

At this point Visual Studio is ready for you to configure, compile (build), and install Freeciv21.

To configure Freeciv21 in Visual Studio you first have to select either the :file:`windows-release` or
:file:`windows-debug` configuration preset as defined in :file:`CMakePresets.json`. On the
:guilabel:`Standard` toolbar, which is enabled by default, you will click the :guilabel:`Target System` drop
down box and pick the :strong:`Local Machine` option. Next you will click the :guilabel:`Configuration` drop
down box and pick the :strong:`windows-release` or :strong:`windows-debug` option. Visual Studio will then
automatically populate the :guilabel:`Build Preset` drop down box based on what you select for
:guilabel:`Configuration`. With these options set you will lastly click :menuselection:`Project --> Configure
Cache`. When this process is complete you can then compile (build) by clicking
:menuselection:`Build --> Build All`. Visual Studio will compile all targets for Freeciv21 and place the
output into the :file:`build-vs` directory. If you want to install Freeciv21 to test any work you are doing,
you can go to :menuselection:`Build --> install Freeciv21`. When complete, you should find a fully functional
install in the :file:`build-vs/install` directory.

.. note:: The preferred :guilabel:`Configuration` is :strong:`debug-windows`, especially if you want to
  troubleshoot code with the built-in debugger and also if you plan to use the unit test feature ``CTest``.

.. note:: The first time you run the Configure Cache command (from
  :menuselection:`Project --> Configure Cache`) or ask Visual Studio to generate the C++ Intellisense data,
  Visual Studio will invoke the :file:`vcpkg` installation process to download and compile all of the project
  dependencies listed in the manifest file: :file:`vcpkg.json`. :strong:`This will take a very long time`. On
  a fast computer with a good Internet connection it will take at least 3 hours to complete. Everything will
  be downloaded and compiled into the :file:`C:\\Tools\\vcpkg` directory, or wherever you configured
  :file:`vcpkg` earlier. Binaries for the packages will be copied into the :file:`./build-vs/` directory
  inside of the main Freeciv21 directory and reused for subsequent builds.

.. attention:: As documented in :doc:`/Getting/compile`, there is a :file:`--target package` option
  available to build an installable package for Windows. This is only available to the MSYS2 environment. This
  does not mean that you can not test an install using Visual Studio. After going to
  :menuselection:`Build --> install Freeciv21` you can still manually start up the client or a server as
  needed to debug. To do this you will start up either the client, the server, or both and then in Visual
  Studio go to :menuselection:`Debug --> Attach to Process`

:strong:`Notes about Clang-Cl vs MSVC`

Freeciv21 has two custom presets specifically for Windows and Visual Studio because Visual Studio defaults to
the MSVC compiler instead of LLVM's Clang-Cl compiler that we installed earlier. The main reason why we do
this is because the code requires proprietary extensions that MSVC does not implement. Instead the Longturn
community supports the open source LLVM Clang-Cl compiler on Windows in Visual Studio as it supports the
required proprietary extensions (note that GNU GCC is used in :doc:`MSYS2 <msys2>` on Windows). If you select
any preset and allow Visual Studio to configure with the Ninja generator and MSVC compiler you will receive a
great number of errors and the build will fail.

If you are interested in configuring and compiling from the command line instead of the GUI, you can use
these commands:

.. code-block:: sh

    cmake --preset windows-debug -S . -B build-vs
    cmake --build build-vs --target install


The first command configures Visual Studio to compile a Debug version of the programs and places the install
location to be a sub-directory of the :file:`build-vs` directory for use during debugging and testing
purposes. This is the same as selecting the :file:`windows-debug` preset configuration. The second and third
command then "builds" and "installs" the configured code solution. You will need to manually start the client
and/or server to test.
